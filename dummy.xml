'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[Political movement|movement]] that rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of [[hierarchy]]. It calls for the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]] which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.

The [[history of anarchism]] goes back to [[prehistory]], when some humans lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states, [[realm]]s or [[empire]]s. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, [[skepticism]] toward authority also rose, but it was not until the 19th century that a self-conscious political movement emerged. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for [[emancipation]]. Various [[anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[Spanish Civil War]], whose end marked the end of [[Classical era of anarchism|anarchism's classical era]]. In the last decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more.

Anarchism employs various tactics in order to meet its ideal ends; these can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics. There is significant overlap between the two which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, and have taken a violent turn in the past. Evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] have played a part in diverse areas of human society. Criticism of anarchism mainly focuses on claims of it being internally inconsistent, violent and utopian.

== Etymology, terminology and definition ==
{{main|Definition of anarchism and libertarianism}}
{{see also|Glossary of anarchism}}
The etymological origin of ''anarchism'' is from the Ancient Greek ''anarkhia'', meaning &quot;without a ruler&quot;, composed of the prefix ''an-'' (i.e. &quot;without&quot;) and the word ''arkhos'' (i.e. &quot;leader&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;). The suffix ''[[-ism]]'' denotes the ideological current that favours [[anarchy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} ''Anarchism'' appears in English from 1642{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|2019|loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} as ''anarchisme'' and ''anarchy'' from 1539.{{sfn|Oxford English Dictionary|2005|loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as ''anarchists'', although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}

The first political philosopher to call himself an ''anarchist'' ({{lang-fr|anarchiste}}) was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} ''[[libertarianism]]'' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|Guerin|1970|loc=&quot;The Basic Ideas of Anarchism&quot;}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=Fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} On the other hand, some use ''libertarianism'' to refer to [[Individualist anarchism|individualistic free-market philosophy]] only, referring to [[free-market anarchism]] as ''libertarian anarchism''.{{sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}

While [[opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p=217}} Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organization]] (including the [[State (polity)|state]], [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and all associated [[institution]]s) in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[voluntary association]], on [[freedom]] and on [[decentralisation]], but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]'' conclusion).{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25–29|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2pp=217}} Nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following:{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}
# The will for a non-coercive society.
# The rejection of the state apparatus.
# The belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society.
# A suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.

&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
As anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought, and disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and tactics is common, its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has created a number of [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. For instance, the compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=565|1ps=: &quot;In fact, few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice, Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid. Anarcho-capitalists, even if they do reject the State, might therefore best be called right-wing libertarians rather than anarchists.&quot;|2a1=Honderich|2y=1995|2p=31|3a1=Meltzer|3y=2000|3p=50|3ps=: &quot;The philosophy of &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot; dreamed up by the &quot;libertarian&quot; [[New Right]], has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper.&quot;|4a1=Goodway|4y=2006|4p=4|4ps=: &quot;'Libertarian' and 'libertarianism' are frequently employed by anarchists as synonyms for 'anarchist' and 'anarchism', largely as an attempt to distance themselves from the negative connotations of 'anarchy' and its derivatives. The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'. It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition.&quot;|5a1=Newman|5y=2010|5p=53|5ps=: &quot;It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism).&quot;}} [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]], [[collectivism]] and [[trade unionism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[Veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]]) and the [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.{{sfn|De George|2005|pp=31–32}}

=== Gender, sexuality and free love ===
{{main|Free love}}
{{see also|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex|Queer anarchism}}

[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Émile Armand]] propounded the virtues of [[free love]] in the [[Anarchism in France|Parisian anarchist milieu]] of the early 20th century]]
Gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy; anarchism is obliged to address, analyse and oppose the suppression of one's autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|p=603}}

A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was [[free love]]; in contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support [[polyamory]] and [[queer anarchism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholas|1y=2019|1p=611|2a1=Jeppesen|2a2=Nazar|2y=2012|2pp=175–176}} Free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. The notion of free love, though, was much broader; it included critique of the established order that limited women's sexual freedom and pleasure.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–176}} Such free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists, and other activists slept in beds together.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|p=177}} Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States. Some anarchists, however, struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–177}} Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, were pro-choice (utilizing a contemporary term) and had a likewise agenda. Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on [[suffrage]], but were nonetheless supportive of one another.{{sfn|Kinna2019|pp=166–167}}

During the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]], radicalizing some currents of the feminist movement (and being influenced as well). By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalized groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=609–611}} With the [[Third-wave feminism|third wave of feminism]], sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, which yielded a [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] critique of sexual normality.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=610–611}} However, some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards individualism and was, therefore, dropping the cause of social liberation.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=616–617}}

The interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. Anarchists consider 'proper' education, which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1pp=83–85|2a2=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=514–515, 520}} Anarchist writers such as [[William Godwin|Willian Godwin]] and [[Max Stirner]] attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.{{sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1pp=514, 521|2a1=Kinna|2y=2019|2pp=83–86|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=222|3ps=. Max Stirner recorded his thoughts in an essay on education titled &quot;[[The False Principle of Our Education]]&quot;. William Godwin's thoughts can be found in his ''[[Political Justice]]''.}}

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer]] established the [[Ferrer movement|Escuela Moderna]] in Barcelona as an opposition to the established education system, which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–512}} Ferrer's approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process, and gave pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. Ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster [[class consciousness]] among students. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later arrested. His ideas, however, formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] around the world.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–514}} Christian anarchist [[Leo Tolstoy]] also established a similar school, with its founding principle, according to Tolstoy, being that &quot;for education to be effective it had to be free&quot;.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=517–518|ps=. For more, see Tolstoy essay's ''Education and Culture''.}} In a similar token, A. S. Neill founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=518–519}}

While few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern day, major tenets of anarchist schools, such as respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=523–526|ps=. Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools, namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part of a wider American-Canadian network of schools; Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton, England; and Paideia School in Spain.}}

== Criticism{{anchor|Criticisms}} ==
lecturer Andrew G. Fiala also believed that humans could not self govern and included it in his list of arguments against anarchism. Fiala's other critiques were that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world (i.e. at protests) but in the world of ethics as well. Secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state can not be defeated practically; this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. The third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory since while it advocates for no-one to ''archiei'', if accepted by the many, then anarchism will turn into the ruling political theory. In this line of criticism also comes the self contradiction that anarchist calls for collective action while anarchism endorses the autonomy of the individual and hence no collective action can be taken. Lastly, Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism, of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|loc=&quot;4. Objections and Replies&quot;}}

Philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia, following the release of pro-anarchist books such as [[A. John Simmons]]' ''Moral Principles and Political Obligations'' (1979).{{sfn|Klosko|1999|p=536}} Law professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay arguing against three major philosophical anarchist principles, which he finds fallacious; Edmundson claims that while the individual does not owe a normal state{{ambiguous|date=June 2020}} a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion, and the state is still morally legitimate.{{sfnm|1a1=Klosko|1y=1999|1p=536|2a1=Kristjánsson|2y=2000|2p=896}}

Academic [[John Molyneux (academic)|John Molyneux]] notes in his book ''Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism'' that &quot;anarchism cannot win&quot; believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas.{{sfn|Dodds|2011}}

[[File:Achilles fighting against Memnon Leiden Rijksmuseum voor Oudheden.jpg|thumb|260px|Ancient Greek polychromatic [[Ancient Greek vase painting|pottery painting]] (dating to {{circa}} 300 BC) of Achilles during the Trojan War]]
{{Greek myth}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Achilles''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|ɪ|l|iː|z}} {{respell|ə|KIL|eez}}) or '''Achilleus''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀχιλλεύς}}, {{IPA-el|a.kʰilˈleu̯s|}}) was a hero of the [[Trojan War]], the greatest of all the Greek warriors, and is the central character of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. He was the son of the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], king of [[Phthia]].

Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince [[Hector]] outside the gates of [[Troy]]. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the ''Iliad'', other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with [[Statius]]' unfinished epic ''[[Achilleid]]'', written in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel because, when his mother [[Thetis]] dipped him in the river [[Styx]] as an infant, she held him by one of his heels. Alluding to these legends, the term &quot;[[Achilles' heel]]&quot; has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution. The [[Achilles tendon]] is also named after him due to these legends.

== Etymology ==

[[Linear B]] tablets attest to the personal name ''Achilleus'' in the forms ''a-ki-re-u'' and ''a-ki-re-we'',&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author1=Dorothea Sigel|title=Achilles|author2=Anne Ley|author3=Bruno Bleckmann|entry=Achilles|encyclopedia=Brill's New Pauly|editor=Hubert Cancik |display-editors=etal |publisher=Brill Reference Online|doi=10.1163/1574-9347_bnp_e102220}} Accessed 5 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the latter being the [[dative case|dative]] of the former.&lt;ref name=Beekes/&gt; The name grew more popular, even becoming common soon after the seventh century BC&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111126201849/http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/search?patt=*AXIL&amp;first=250 Epigraphical database] gives 476 matches for Ἀχιλ-.The earliest ones: [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=27810&amp;bookid=6&amp;region=2&amp;subregion=1 Corinth 7th c. BC], [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=238250&amp;bookid=118&amp;region=3&amp;subregion=7 Delphi 530 BC], Attica and Elis 5th c. BC.&lt;/ref&gt; and was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία (''Achilleía''), attested in [[Attica]] in the fourth century BC ([[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]] II² 1617) and, in the form ''Achillia'', on a [[Female gladiator#Halicarnassus|stele in Halicarnassus]] as the name of a female gladiator fighting an &quot;Amazon&quot;.

Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of {{lang|grc|ἄχος}} (''{{transl|grc|áchos}}'') &quot;distress, pain, sorrow, grief&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scholia to the ''Iliad'', 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|λαός}} (''{{transl|grc|laós}}'') &quot;people, soldiers, nation&quot;, resulting in a proto-form ''*Akhí-lāu̯os'' &quot;he who has the people distressed&quot; or &quot;he whose people have distress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard Palmer|title=The Interpretation of Mycenaean Greek Texts|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1963|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nagy&gt;{{cite web|author=Gregory Nagy|title=The best of the Achaeans|url=http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5442|website=CHS|publisher=The Center for Hellenic Studies, Harvard University|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the ''Iliad'' (and frequently by Achilles himself). Achilles' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of {{lang|grc|κλέος}} ''{{transl|grc|kléos}}'' (&quot;glory&quot;, usually in war). Furthermore, ''laós'' has been construed by [[Gregory Nagy]], following [[Leonard Palmer]], to mean &quot;a corps of soldiers&quot;, a [[muster (military)|muster]].&lt;ref name=Nagy/&gt; With this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

[[File:The Education of Achilles 1862 Delacroix.jpg|thumb|right|''The Education of Achilles'', by [[Eugène Delacroix]], pastel on paper, c.&amp;nbsp;1862 ([[Getty Center]], Los Angeles)]]

Another etymology relates the name to a [[Proto-Indo-European]] [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''*h₂eḱ-pṓds'' &quot;sharp foot&quot; which first gave an [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]] ''*āk̂pediós'', evolving through time into ''*ākhpdeós'' and then ''*akhiddeús''. The shift from ''-dd-'' to ''-ll-'' is then ascribed to the passing of the name into Greek via a [[Pre-Greek]] source. The first root part ''*h₂eḱ-'' &quot;sharp, pointed&quot; also gave Greek ἀκή (''akḗ'' &quot;point, silence, healing&quot;), ἀκμή (''akmḗ'' &quot;point, edge, zenith&quot;) and ὀξύς (''oxús'' &quot;sharp, pointed, keen, quick, clever&quot;), whereas ἄχος stems from the root ''*h₂egʰ-'' &quot;to be upset, afraid&quot;. The whole expression would be comparable to the [[Latin]] ''acupedius'' &quot;swift of foot&quot;. Compare also the Latin word family of ''aciēs'' &quot;sharp edge or point, battle line, battle, engagement&quot;, ''acus'' &quot;needle, pin, bodkin&quot;, and ''acuō'' &quot;to make pointed, sharpen, whet; to exercise; to arouse&quot; (whence ''acute'').&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the Wiktionary entries [[wikt:Ἀχιλλεύς|&quot;Ἀχιλλεύς&quot;]] and [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₂eḱ-|''*h₂eḱ-'']].&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Literary topos|topical]] [[epitheta]] of Achilles in the ''Iliad'' point to this &quot;swift-footedness&quot;, namely ποδάρκης δῖος Ἀχιλλεὺς (''podárkēs dĩos Achilleús'' &quot;swift-footed divine Achilles&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 1.121, 2.688.&lt;/ref&gt; or, even more frequently, πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς (''pódas ōkús Achilleús'' &quot;quick-footed Achilles&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;E. g. ''Iliad'' 1.58, 1.84, 1.148, 1.215, 1.364, 1.489.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers deem the name a [[loan word]], possibly from a [[Pre-Greek]] language.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot;/&gt; Achilles' descent from the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and a similarity of his name with those of [[Potamoi|river deities]] such as [[Acheron]] and [[Achelous]] have led to speculations about him being an old [[Greek sea gods|water divinity]] (see below [[Achilles#Worship|Worship]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the supportive position of {{cite journal|author=Hildebrecht Hommel|title=Der Gott Achilleus|journal=Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften|issue=1|year=1980|pages=38–44}}&amp;nbsp;– A critical point of view is taken by {{cite journal|author=J. T. Hooker|title=The cults of Achilleus|journal=Rheinisches Museum für Philologie|volume=131|issue=3|date=1988|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin of the name, based among other things on the coexistence of ''-λλ-'' and ''-λ-'' in epic language, which may account for a palatalized phoneme /l&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;/ in the original language.&lt;ref name=Beekes&gt;Robert S. P. Beekes, ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 183ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth and early years ==

Achilles was the son of the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and of [[Peleus]], the king of the [[Myrmidons]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until [[Prometheus]], the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy (originally uttered by [[Themis]], goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheus Bound'' 755–768; [[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' 5.34–37, ''Isthmian'' 8.26–47; Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.5; ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'' 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 181.jpg|thumb|left|''Thetis Dipping the Infant Achilles into the River Styx'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1625; [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]], Rotterdam)]]

There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: In the ''[[Argonautica]]'' (4.760) Zeus' sister and wife [[Hera]] alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god [[Nereus]], was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus. Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Education of Achilles, by James Barry.jpg|thumb|''The Education of Achilles'' (c. 1772), by [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] ([[Yale Center for British Art]])]]

According to the ''[[Achilleid]]'', written by [[Statius]] in the 1st century AD, and to [[Lost works|non-surviving previous sources]], when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river [[Styx]]; however, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Achilleid'' 1.269; Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Jonathan S. Burgess| title = The Death and Afterlife of Achilles| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ko_YAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9| accessdate = 5 February 2010| year = 2009| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| location = Baltimore| isbn = 978-0-8018-9029-1| page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Achilles' heel]], [[Achilles' tendon]]). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869–879.&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the sources before Statius make any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the ''Iliad'' Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the [[Paeonian]] hero [[Asteropaeus]], son of [[Pelagon]], challenged Achilles by the river [[Scamander]]. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, &quot;drawing a spurt of blood&quot;.

Also, in the fragmentary poems of the [[Epic Cycle]] in which one can find description of the hero's death (i.e. the ''[[Cypria]]'', the ''[[Little Iliad]]'' by [[Lesches]] of Pyrrha, the ''[[Aithiopis]]'' and ''[[Iliou persis]]'' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]]), there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel; in the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his torso.

Peleus entrusted Achilles to [[Chiron]] the [[Centaur]], on [[Mount Pelion]], to be reared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Catalogue of Women'', fr. 204.87–89 MW; ''Iliad'' 11.830–832.&lt;/ref&gt; Thetis foretold that her son's fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity. Achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the Trojan war.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.410ff.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Homer, Achilles grew up in Phthia together with his companion [[Patroclus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Photius]], the sixth book of the ''New History'' by [[Ptolemy Hephaestion]] reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus; but when she had Achilles, Peleus noticed, tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot, and confided him to the centaur Chiron. Later Chiron exhumed the body of the [[Damysus (Giant)|Damysus]], who was the fastest of all the giants, removed the ankle, and incorporated it into Achilles' burnt foot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/photius_copyright/photius_05bibliotheca.htm Photius, ''Bibliotheca'', cod. 190]: &quot;Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus; six were born; when she had Achilles, Peleus noticed and tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to Chiron.  The latter exhumed the body of the giant Damysos who was buried at Pallene—Damysos was the fastest of all the giants—removed the 'astragale' and incorporated it into Achilles' foot using 'ingredients'.  This 'astragale' fell when Achilles was pursued by Apollo and it was thus that Achilles, fallen, was killed.  It is said, on the other hand, that he was called Podarkes by the Poet, because, it is said, Thetis gave the newborn child the wings of Arce and Podarkes means that his feet had the wings of Arce.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other names ===
Among the appellations under which Achilles is generally known are the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Classical Manual: Being a Mythological, Historical and Geographical Commentary on Pope's Homer, and Dryden's Aeneid of Virgil, with a Copious Index|last=Murray|first=John|year=1833|location=Albemarle Street, London|pages=3}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Pyrisous''', &quot;saved from the fire&quot;, his first name, which seems to favour the tradition in which his mortal parts were burned by his mother Thetis
* '''Aeacides''', from his grandfather [[Aeacus]]
* '''Aemonius''', from Aemonia, a country which afterwards acquired the name of Thessaly
* '''Aspetos''', &quot;inimitable&quot; or &quot;vast&quot;, his name at [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]]
* '''Larissaeus''', from [[Larissa]] (also called Cremaste), a town of Thessaly, which still bears the same name
* '''Ligyron''', his original name
* '''Nereius''', from his mother Thetis, one of the [[Nereid]]s
* '''Pelides''', from his father, [[Peleus]]
* '''Phthius''', from his birthplace, [[Phthia]]
* '''Podarkes''', “swift-footed”, due to the wings of Arke being attached to his feet.&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy Hephaestion, New History Book 6 (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 190) (trans. Pearse) (Greek mythographer C1st to C2nd A.D.) :

&quot;It is said . . . that he [Akhilleus (Achilles)] was called Podarkes (Podarces, Swift-Footed) by the Poet [i.e. Homer], because, it is said, Thetis gave the newborn child the wings of Arke (Arce) and Podarkes means that his feet had the wings of Arke. And Arke was the daughter of Thaumas and her sister was Iris; both had wings, but, during the struggle of the gods against the Titanes (Titans), Arke flew out of the camp of the gods and joined the Titanes. After the victory Zeus removed her wings before throwing her into Tartaros and, when he came to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, he brought these wings as a gift for Thetis.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hidden on Skyros ===
{{main|Achilles on Skyros}}

Some post-Homeric sources&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''Skyrioi'', surviving only in fragmentary form; [[Philostratus III|Philostratus Junior]], ''Imagines'' i; Scholiast on Homer's ''Iliad'', 9.326; [[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' 13.162–180; Ovid, ''[[Tristia]]'' 2.409–412 (mentioning a Roman tragedy on this subject); Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.8; [[Statius]], ''[[Achilleid]]'' 1.689–880, 2.167ff.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hid the young man at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]]. There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name &quot;Pyrrha&quot; (the red-haired girl). With Lycomedes' daughter [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidamia]], whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, [[Neoptolemus]] (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias). According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewellery and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.

== In the Trojan War ==

[[File:Achilles Agamemnon Pompei mosaic NAMNaples 10006.jpg|thumb|Achilles and [[Agamemnon]], from a [[mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD]]

According to the ''Iliad'', Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 [[Myrmidons]]. He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, [[Eudorus]], Peisander, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]] and Alcimedon.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 16.168–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telephus ===
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;. Guided by the oracle, he arrived at [[Argos]], where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epitome 3.20&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pseudo-Apollodorus|title=Bibliotheca, Epitome 3.20|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/ApollodorusE.html#69|website=theoi.com|ref=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to other reports in [[Euripides]]' [[lost works|lost play]] about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epitome 3.20&quot;/&gt;

=== Troilus ===

According to the ''[[Cypria]]'' (the part of the [[Epic Cycle]] that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' wrath), when the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of [[Aeneas]], sacked neighbouring cities (like [[Pedasus]] and [[Lyrnessus]], where the Greeks capture the queen [[Briseis]]) and killed [[Tenes]], a son of [[Apollo]], as well as Priam's son [[Troilus]] in the sanctuary of [[Apollo]] [[Thymbra]]ios; however, the romance between Troilus and [[Chryseis]] described in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' and in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' is a medieval invention.&lt;ref name=&quot;stoa.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 |title=Proclus' Summary of the Cypria |publisher=Stoa.org |accessdate=9 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009120320/http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 |archive-date=9 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot;/&gt;

=== In the ''Iliad'' ===
{{main|Iliad}}

[[File:Achilles Briseis MAN Napoli Inv9105 n01.jpg|thumb|Achilles cedes [[Briseis]] to [[Agamemnon]], from the [[House of the Tragic Poet]] in [[Pompeii]], fresco, 1st century AD ([[Naples National Archaeological Museum]])]]

Homer's ''Iliad'' is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles' wrath (μῆνις Ἀχιλλέως, ''mênis Achilléōs'') is the central theme of the poem. The first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|Μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληιάδεω Ἀχιλῆος&lt;br&gt;
οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκε, [...]
|Sing, Goddess, of the rage of Peleus' son Achilles,&lt;br&gt;
the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the Achaeans, [...]
|}

The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] forces. Agamemnon has taken a woman named [[Chryseis]] as his slave. Her father [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo]], begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses, and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet [[Calchas]] correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so, and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles' battle prize [[Briseis]], the daughter of [[Briseus]], be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis),&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.334–343.&lt;/ref&gt; with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles [[Homeric prayer|prays]] to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honour.

As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sends [[Odysseus]] and two other chieftains, [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]], to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.

[[File:The Rage of Achilles by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|left|''The Rage of Achilles'', fresco by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] (1757, Villa Valmarana ai Nani, Vicenza)]]

The Trojans, led by [[Hector]], subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, [[Patroclus]] leads the [[Myrmidons]] into battle, wearing Achilles' armour, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from [[Antilochus]], the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades [[Hephaestus]] to make new armour for him, in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by Hector. The new armour includes the [[Shield of Achilles]], described in great detail in the poem.

Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god [[Scamander]], who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by [[Hera]] and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before [[Athena]], in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, [[Deiphobus]], persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that &quot;my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Iliad&quot;, Fagles translation. Penguin Books, 1991: 22.346.&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot. After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral, Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lattimore |first1=Richmond |title=The Illiad of Homer |date=2011 |publisher=The University of Chicago |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-46937-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/iliad00home_5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the onset of his duel with Hector, Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky, which comes on in the autumn, Orion's dog ([[Sirius]]); a sign of evil. During the cremation of Patroclus, he is compared to [[Hesperus]], the evening/western star ([[Venus]]), while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]], the morning/eastern star (also Venus) has set (descended).

With the assistance of the god [[Hermes]] (Argeiphontes), Hector's father [[Priam]] goes to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector's body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral, lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th (in the tradition of [[Niobe]]'s offspring). The poem ends with a description of Hector's funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.

=== Later epic accounts: fighting Penthesilea and Memnon ===

[[File:Akhilleus Memnon Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1410.jpg|thumb|Achilles and Memnon fighting, between Thetis and Eos, Attic black-figure amphora, c. 510 BC, from Vulci]]

The ''[[Aethiopis]]'' (7th century BC) and a work named ''[[Posthomerica]]'', composed by [[Quintus of Smyrna]] in the fourth century AD, relate further events from the [[Trojan War]]. When [[Penthesilea]], queen of the [[Amazons]] and daughter of [[Ares]], arrives in Troy, Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles. After his temporary truce with Priam, Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen, only to grieve over her death later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Propertius]], 3.11.15; [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] 1.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.&lt;!--- Sources for this? &quot;Achilles fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Helene (Amazon)|Helene]].&quot; --&gt;

Following the death of Patroclus, Nestor's son [[Antilochus]] becomes Achilles' closest companion. When [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], son of the Dawn Goddess [[Eos]] and king of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]], slays Antilochus, Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. Consequently, Eos will not let the sun rise, until Zeus persuades her. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad''{{'}}s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] ''[[Aethiopis]]'', which was composed after the ''Iliad'', possibly in the 7th century BC. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.

=== Achilles and Patroclus ===
{{main|Achilles and Patroclus}}

[[File:Akhilleus Patroklos Antikensammlung Berlin F2278.jpg|thumb|Achilles tending Patroclus wounded by an arrow, Attic red-figure [[kylix]], c. 500 BC ([[Altes Museum]], Berlin)]]

The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the ''Iliad'', it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were lovers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Tribal Imagination: Civilization and the Savage Mind |author= Robin Fox |year= 2011 |publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674060944 |quote= There is certainly no evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers.|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=YCxy_4Bt1F0C&amp;pg=PA223 223]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Alexander the Great: The Story of an Ancient Life|last= Martin |first= Thomas R |year= 2012 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0521148443 |quote= The ancient sources do not report, however, what modern scholars have asserted: that Alexander and his very close friend Hephaestion were lovers. Achilles and his equally close friend Patroclus provided the legendary model for this friendship, but Homer in the ''Iliad'' never suggested that they had sex with each other. (That came from later authors.) If Alexander and Hephaestion did have a sexual relationship, it would have been transgressive by majority Greek standards ... |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no direct evidence in the text of the ''Iliad'' that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors. Commentators from [[classical antiquity]] to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek custom of ''paiderasteia'']]. In Plato's ''Symposium'', the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Sym.+180a 180a]; the beauty of Achilles was a topic already broached at ''Iliad'' 2.673–674.&lt;/ref&gt; But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Dover]], ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 1 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. Many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship.

=== Death ===
{{anchor|Fatalwound}}

The death of Achilles, even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources, is a complex one, with many different versions.&lt;ref&gt;Abrantes 2016: c. 4.3.1&lt;/ref&gt; In the oldest one, the ''Iliad'', and as predicted by [[Hector]] with his dying breath, the hero's death was brought about by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god [[Apollo]] guided Paris' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow. All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valour, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of [[Patroclus]], and funeral games were held. He was represented in the ''Aethiopis'' as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]].

[[File:Closeup of Achilles thniskon in Corfu Achilleion autocorrected.JPG|thumb|left|''Dying Achilles'' (Achilleas thniskon) in the gardens of the Achilleion]]

Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, [[Polyxena]]. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.

In the ''Odyssey'', Agamemnon informs Achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his [[mound]] at the [[Hellespont]] while they are receiving the dead [[Suitors of Penelope|suitors]] in Hades.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 24.36–94.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of Ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In Book 11 of Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 11.467–564.&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life.

According to some accounts, he had married [[Medea]] in life, so that after both their deaths they were united in the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] of [[Hades]]&amp;nbsp;– as Hera promised Thetis in [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' (3rd century BC).

=== Fate of Achilles' armour ===

[[File:Aias body Akhilleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1884.jpg|thumb|right|Ajax carries off the body of Achilles, [[Attica|Attic]] black-figure [[lekythos]] from Sicily (c. 510 BC – [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich)]]

Achilles' armour was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Ajax the Great|Telamonian Ajax]] (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men's presentations decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned him the ire of Athena, who temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, he was so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armour to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles. When Odysseus encounters the shade of Ajax much later in the House of Hades (''Odyssey'' 11.543–566), Ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to Odysseus.

A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of [[Phaselis]], Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by [[Alexander the Great]], who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the ''Iliad'' with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear; however, it was shown in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexander came to rest at Phaselis, a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of Achilles' original spear.&quot; Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'', 1973, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, iii.3.6; see Christian Jacob and Anne Mullen-Hohl, &quot;The Greek Traveler's Areas of Knowledge: Myths and Other Discourses in Pausanias' Description of Greece&quot;, ''Yale French Studies'' '''59''': ''Rethinking History: Time, Myth, and Writing'' (1980:65–85, especially 81).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achilles, Ajax and a game of ''petteia'' ===

Numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions. At some point in the war, Achilles and [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] were playing a [[board game]] (''petteia'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/wxk116/roma/petteia.html &quot;Petteia&quot;.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209122834/http://www.personal.psu.edu/wxk116/roma/petteia.html |date=9 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Austin/index.html &quot;Greek Board Games&quot;.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408090534/http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Austin/index.html |date=8 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/w/x/wxk116/roma/latruncu.html &quot;Latrunculi&quot;.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915044905/http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/w/x/wxk116/roma/latruncu.html |date=15 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes, who were saved only by an intervention of Athena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioannis Kakridis]] (1988).

The spread and intensity of the hero's veneration among the [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Greeks]] that had [[Second Greek colonisation|settled]] on the northern coast of the [[Pontus Euxinus]], today's Black Sea, appears to have been remarkable.

T. Hooker|title=The cults of Achilleus|journal=Rheinisches Museum für Philologie|volume=131|issue=3|date=1988|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the sixth century BC onwards. The cult was still thriving in the third century AD, when dedicatory [[stelae]] from Olbia refer to an ''Achilles Pontárchēs'' (Ποντάρχης, roughly &quot;lord of the Sea,&quot; or &quot;of the [[Pontus Euxinus]]&quot;), who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia, venerated on par with [[Olympian gods]] such as the local [[Apollo]] Prostates, [[Hermes]] Agoraeus,&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt; or [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref&gt;Quintus Smyrnaeus, 3.770–779.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 AD) in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' mentions a &quot;port of the Achæi&quot; and an &quot;island of Achilles&quot;, famous for the tomb of that &quot;man&quot; (portus Achaeorum, insula Achillis, tumulo eius viri clara), situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the [[Dnieper-Bug Estuary]]; furthermore, at 125&amp;nbsp;[[Roman mile]]s from this island, he places a peninsula &quot;which stretches forth in the shape of a sword&quot; obliquely, called ''Dromos Achilleos'' (Ἀχιλλέως δρόμος, ''Achilléōs drómos'' &quot;[[Racecourse of Achilles|the Race-course of Achilles]]&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.12.83 ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D26#note-link10 chapter 4.26]).&lt;/ref&gt; and considered the place of the hero's exercise or of games instituted by him.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt; This last feature of Pliny's account is considered to be the iconic [[Spit (landform)|spit]], called today ''Tendra'' (or ''Kosa Tendra'' and ''Kosa Djarilgatch''), situated between the mouth of the [[Dnieper]] and [[Karkinit Bay]], but which is hardly 125&amp;nbsp;[[Roman mile]]s (c. 185&amp;nbsp;km) away from the [[Dnieper-Bug estuary]], as Pliny states. (To the &quot;Race-course&quot; he gives a length of 80&amp;nbsp;miles, c.&amp;nbsp;120&amp;nbsp;km, whereas the spit measures c.&amp;nbsp;70&amp;nbsp;km today.)

In the following chapter of his book, Pliny refers to the same island as ''Achillea'' and introduces two further names for it: ''Leuce'' or ''Macaron'' (from Greek [νῆσος] μακαρῶν &quot;island of the blest&quot;). The &quot;present day&quot; measures, he gives at this point, seem to account for an identification of ''Achillea'' or ''Leuce'' with today's Snake Island.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.13.93 ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D27 chapter 4.27]): &quot;Researches which have been made at the present day place this island at a distance of 140 miles from the Borysthenes, of 120 from [[Tyras]], and of fifty from the island of [[Peuce Island|Peuce]]. It is about ten miles in circumference.&quot; Though afterwards he speaks again of &quot;the remaining islands in the Gulf of [[Kerkinitis|Carcinites]]&quot; which are &quot;Cephalonesos, Rhosphodusa [or Spodusa], and Macra&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's contemporary [[Pomponius Mela]] (c. 43 AD) tells that Achilles was buried on an island named ''Achillea'', situated between the [[Borysthenes]] and the [[Danube|Ister]], adding to the geographical confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Pomponius Mela, ''De situ orbis'' 2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruins of a square temple, measuring 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823 on Snake Island. A second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. A fifth century BC [[Black-glazed Ware|black-glazed]] [[lekythos]] inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads: &quot;Glaukos, son of Poseidon, dedicated me to Achilles, lord of Leuke.&quot; In another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC, a statue is dedicated to Achilles, lord of Leuke, by a citizen of Olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island's cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt;

The heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on ''Leuce'' seems to go back to an account from the lost epic ''[[Aethiopis]]'' according to which, after his untimely death, Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical Λεύκη Νῆσος (''Leúkē Nêsos'' &quot;White Island&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Proclus]], ''Chrestomathia'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Already in the fifth century BC, [[Pindar]] had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a &quot;bright island&quot; (φαεννά νᾶσος, ''phaenná nâsos'') of the Black Sea,&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.49ff.; Arrian, ''[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' 21.&lt;/ref&gt; while in another of his works, Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite [[Island of the Blest]] together with other heroes such as his father [[Peleus]] and [[Cadmus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Olympia'' 2.78ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Well known is the connection of these mythological [[Fortunate Isles]] (μακαρῶν νῆσοι, ''makárôn nêsoi'') or the Homeric [[Elysium]] with the stream [[Oceanus]] which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt; Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], speaking of &quot;Achilles lord of Scythia&quot;&lt;ref&gt;D. Page, ''Lyrica Graeca Selecta'', Oxford 1968, p. 89, no. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and the opposition of North and South, as evoked by Achilles' fight against the [[Aethiopia]]n prince [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother [[Eos]] after his death.

The ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' (c. 130 AD) gives the following details:

{{quote|It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus' honour, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honour Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles' temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles' honour. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles' oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn't run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Densuşianu&quot;/&gt;}}

The Greek geographer [[Dionysius Periegetes]], who lived probably during the first century AD, wrote that the island was called ''Leuce'' &quot;because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius Periegetes, ''Orbis descriptio'' 5.541, quoted in Densuşianu 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, others relate the island's name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' 21; Scholion to Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is &quot;covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles' temple and his statue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias reports that the [[Delphi]]c [[Pythia]] sent a lord of [[Crotone|Croton]] to be cured of a chest wound.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' 22.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles. [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Strabo]] reported on the existence of a town ''Achílleion'' (Ἀχίλλειον), built by settlers from [[Mytilene]] in the sixth century BC, close to the hero's presumed burial mound in the [[Troad]].&lt;ref name=Troad/&gt; Later attestations point to an ''Achílleion'' in [[Messenia]] (according to [[Stephanus Byzantinus]]) and an ''Achílleios'' (Ἀχίλλειος) in [[Laconia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.25.4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolae Densuşianu]] recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of [[Aquileia]] and of the northern arm of the Danube delta, called [[Chilia Veche|Chilia]] (presumably from an older ''Achileii''), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Densuşianu&quot;&gt;Nicolae Densuşianu: ''Dacia preistorică''. Bucharest: Carol Göbl, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kings of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, [[Neoptolemus]]. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epirote princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at [[Achilleion (Troad)#Tomb of Achilles|Achilleion]] while passing Troy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' 1.12.1, [[Cicero]], ''Pro Archia Poeta'' 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 216 the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]], while on his way to war against [[Parthia]], emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]] 78.16.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception during antiquity ==
=== In Greek tragedy ===
{{main|Achilleis (trilogy)}}
The [[tragedy|Greek tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of [[Hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and guided by [[Apollo]] punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy, ''The Myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.&lt;ref&gt;Pantelis Michelakis, ''Achilles in Greek Tragedy'', 2002, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's ''Symposium'', Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium'', translated Benjamin Jowett, Dover Thrift Editions, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote ''The Lovers of Achilles'', a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.&lt;ref&gt;S. Radt. ''Tragicorum Graecorum fragmenta'', vol. 4, (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1977) frr. 149–157a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 5th century BC, a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; [[Euripides]] refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'', ''[[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]]'', and ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latacz 2010&quot;&gt;Latacz 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Greek philosophy ===
The philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] centred one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] on an imaginary footrace between &quot;[[Epithets in Homer#Individuals|swift-footed]]&quot; [[Zeno's paradoxes#Achilles and the tortoise|Achilles and a tortoise]], by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

=== Achilles in Roman and medieval literature ===
The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latacz 2010&quot;/&gt; [[Virgil]] refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men,&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 2.28, 1.30, 3.87.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Horace]] portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.&lt;ref&gt;''Odes'' 4.6.17–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers, such as [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], and [[Ovid]], represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles' erotic career. This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as [[Dictys Cretensis]] and [[Dares Phrygius]] and in [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]]'s ''[[Roman de Troie]]'' and [[Guido delle Colonne]]'s ''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]'', which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the [[Matter of Troy]] until the 17th century.

Achilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler [[Leo the Deacon]], not as [[Hellenes|Hellene]], but as [[Scythians|Scythian]], while according to the Byzantine author [[John Malalas]], his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as [[Bulgars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekonomou|first1=Andrew|title=Byzantine Rome and the Greek Popes|date=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=UK|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zomZk6DbFTIC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20malalas%20myrmidons%20achilles|accessdate=14 September 2015|isbn=9780739119778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Croke|first2=Brian|title=Studies in John Malalas|location=Australian Association for Byzantine Studies, Department of Modern Greek, University of Sydney|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p55mAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles&amp;dq=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles|accessdate=14 September 2015|isbn=9780959362657|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Namesakes ==
* The name of Achilles has been used for at least nine [[Royal Navy]] warships since 1744 – both as {{HMS|Achilles}} and with the French spelling {{HMS|Achille}}. A 60-gun ship of that name served at the Battle of Belleisle in 1761 while a 74-gun ship served at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Other battle honours include Walcheren 1809. An armored cruiser of that name served in the Royal Navy during the First World War.
* {{HMNZS|Achilles|70|6}} was a {{sclass-|Leander|cruiser|1||1931}} which served with the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] in World War II. It became famous for its part in the [[Battle of the River Plate]], alongside {{HMS|Ajax|22|6}} and {{HMS|Exeter|68|6}}. In addition to earning the battle honour 'River Plate', HMNZS ''Achilles'' also served at Guadalcanal 1942–1943 and Okinawa in 1945. After returning to the Royal Navy, the ship was sold to the [[Indian Navy]] in 1948, but when she was scrapped parts of the ship were saved and preserved in New Zealand.
* A species of lizard, ''[[List of Anolis lizards|Anolis achilles]]'', which has widened heel plates, is named for Achilles.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

'''Abraham Lincoln''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|ŋ|k|ən}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lincoln &amp;#124; Definition of Lincoln by Merriam-Webster|website=Merriam-Webster|access-date=5 May 2020|url-status=live|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Lincoln}}&lt;/ref&gt; February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th [[president of the United States]] from 1861 to 1865. Lincoln led the nation through its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis in the [[American Civil War]]. He succeeded in preserving the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|abolishing slavery]], bolstering the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and modernizing the [[Economy of the United States|U.S. economy]].

Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin and was raised on the [[American frontier|frontier]] primarily in [[Indiana]]. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President [[1860 United States presidential election|in 1860]], sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].

As the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrat]]s rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. Anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|&quot;Copperheads&quot;]]) despised him, and irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the U.S. people. His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect and recruit former  slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which outlawed slavery across the country.

Lincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], Lincoln was attending the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at [[Ford's Theatre]] with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. His marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary. Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero, and he is consistently [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States#Scholar survey results|ranked]] as the greatest U.S. president in history.

==Family and childhood==
===Early life===
{{Main|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln}}
Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy Hanks Lincoln]], in a one-room log cabin on [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park|Sinking Spring Farm]] near [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=20–22}} He was a descendant of [[Samuel Lincoln]], an Englishman who migrated from [[Hingham, Norfolk]], to its namesake, [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], in 1638. The family then migrated west, passing through [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]].{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=3–4}} Lincoln's paternal grandparents, his namesake [[Abraham Lincoln (captain)|Captain Abraham Lincoln]] and wife Bathsheba (née Herring), moved the family from Virginia to [[Jefferson County, Kentucky]]. The captain was killed in an [[Northwest Indian War|Indian raid]] in 1786.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=4}} His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, Abraham's father, witnessed the attack.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=21}}{{efn|Thomas, born January 1778, would have been 8 at the attack, May 1786. Older sources use six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Douglas Lawson|last2=Davis|first2=Rodney O.|last3=Wilson|first3=Terry|first4=William Henry|last4=Herndon|first5=Jesse William|last5=Weik|title=Herndon's Informants: Letters, Interviews, and Statements about Abraham Lincoln|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=s2gilcp4yYQC|page=35}} |year=1998|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-02328-6|pages=35–36|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113192331/https://books.google.com/books?id=s2gilcp4yYQC|archivedate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thomas then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and [[Tennessee]] before the family settled in [[Hardin County, Kentucky]] in the early 1800s.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=21}}

The [[Nancy Hanks Lincoln heritage|heritage of Lincoln's mother Nancy]] remains unclear, but it is widely assumed that she was the daughter of Lucy Hanks.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|p=79}} Thomas and Nancy married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=9}} They had three children: [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah]], Abraham, and Thomas, who died an infant.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=9–10}}

Thomas Lincoln bought or leased farms in Kentucky before losing all but {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of his land in court disputes over [[Title (property)|property titles]].{{sfn|Sandburg|1926|p=20}} In 1816, the family moved to [[Indiana]] where the land surveys and titles were more reliable.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=13}} Indiana was a [[Slave states and free states|&quot;free&quot; (non-slaveholding)]] territory, and they settled in an &quot;unbroken forest&quot;{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=26}} in Hurricane Township, [[History of Perry County, Indiana|Perry County, Indiana]].{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=16, 43}}{{efn|Their land eventually became part of [[Spencer County, Indiana]], when the county was established in 1818.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=3, 5, 16}}}} In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot;, but mainly due to land title difficulties.{{sfnm|Sandburg|1926|1p=20|Donald|1996|2pp=23–24}}
[[File:Log Cabin at the Lincoln Living Historical Farm.jpg|thumb|right|The farm site where Lincoln grew up in [[Spencer County, Indiana]]]]
In Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=34, 156}} At various times, he owned farms, livestock and town lots, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, and served on county patrols. Thomas and Nancy were members of a [[Separate Baptists]] church, which forbade alcohol, dancing, and slavery.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=22–24}}

Overcoming financial challenges, Thomas in 1827 obtained [[clear title]] to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} in Indiana, an area which became the [[Little Pigeon Creek Community]].{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=24, 104}}

===Mother's death===
On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln succumbed to [[milk sickness]], leaving 11-year-old Sarah in charge of a household including her father, 9-year-old Abraham, and Nancy's 19-year-old orphan cousin, Dennis Hanks.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=22–23, 77}} Ten years later, on January 20, 1828, Sarah died while giving birth to a [[stillborn]] son, devastating Lincoln.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=34, 116}}

On December 2, 1819, Thomas married [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]], a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=23, 83}} Abraham became close to his stepmother, and called her &quot;Mother&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=26–27}} Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with farm life. His family even said he was lazy, for all his &quot;reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc&quot;.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=25, 31, 47}} His stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy &quot;physical labor&quot;, but loved to read.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|p=66}}

===Education and move to Illinois===
[[File:Young Lincoln By Charles Keck.JPG|thumb|right|''Young Lincoln'' by [[Charles Keck]] at Senn Park, Chicago|alt=A statue of young Lincoln sitting on a stump, holding a book open on his lap]]
Lincoln was mostly self-educated, except for some schooling from itinerant teachers of less than 12 months aggregate.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=10, 33}} He persisted as an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning.{{sfn|Madison|2014|p=110}} Family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that his reading included the [[King James Version|King James Bible]], [[Aesop's Fables]], [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', and ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]]''.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=29–31, 38–43}}

As a teen, Lincoln took responsibility for chores, and customarily gave his father all earnings from work outside the home until he was 21.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=30–33}} Lincoln was tall, strong, and athletic, and became adept at using an ax.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=134–135}} He gained a reputation for strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of ruffians known as &quot;the Clary's Grove boys&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=41}}

In March 1830, fearing another milk sickness outbreak, several members of the extended Lincoln family, including Thomas, moved west to Illinois, a free state, and settled in [[Macon County, Illinois|Macon County]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=36}}{{efn|Historians disagree on who initiated the move; Thomas Lincoln had no obvious reason to do so. One possibility is that other members of the family, including Dennis Hanks, may not have matched Thomas's stability and steady income.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=38–40}}}} Abraham then became increasingly distant from Thomas, in part due to his father's lack of education.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|p=71}} In 1831, as Thomas and other family prepared to move to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois]], Abraham struck out on his own.{{sfn|Oates|1974|pp=15–17}} He made his home in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem, Illinois]] for six years.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=23–53}} Lincoln and some friends took goods by [[flatboat]] to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], where he was first exposed to slavery.{{sfnm|Sandburg|1926|1pp=22–23|Donald|1996|2p=38}}

Lincoln's first romantic interest was [[Ann Rutledge]], whom he met when he moved to New Salem. By 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gannett |first=Lewis |date=Winter 2005 |title=&quot;Overwhelming Evidence&quot; of a Lincoln-Ann Rutledge Romance?: Reexamining Rutledge Family Reminiscences |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext |magazine=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association |location=Springfield, IL |publisher=The Abraham Lincoln Association |pages=28–41 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403014805/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext |archivedate=April 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She died on August 25, 1835, most likely of [[typhoid fever]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=55–58}} In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=56–57, 69–70}}

Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Owens if she returned to New Salem. Owens arrived that November and he courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts. On August 16, 1837, he wrote Owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship, and she never replied.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=67}}

Lincoln in 1839 met [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]], and the following year they became engaged.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=80–86}} She was the daughter of [[Robert Smith Todd]], a wealthy lawyer and businessman in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Lamb|Swain|2008|p=3}} A wedding set for January 1, 1841 was canceled at Lincoln's request, but they reconciled and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's sister.{{sfn|Sandburg|1926|pp=46–51}} While anxiously preparing for the nuptials, he was asked where he was going and replied, &quot;To hell, I suppose.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=93}} In 1844, the couple bought [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site|a house]] in Springfield near his law office. Mary kept house with the help of a relative and hired servant.{{sfn|Baker|1989|p=142}}

Lincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons, though his work regularly kept him away from home. The oldest, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], was born in 1843 and was the only child to live to maturity. [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] (Eddie), born in 1846, died February 1, 1850, probably of tuberculosis. Lincoln's third son, [[William Wallace Lincoln|&quot;Willie&quot; Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever at the [[White House]] on February 20, 1862. The youngest, [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln]], was born on April 4, 1853, and survived his father but died of heart failure at age 18 on July 16, 1871.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=179–181, 476}}{{efn|The Lincolns' last descendant, great-grandson [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]], died in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Emerson|title=Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T.

Herndon]] would grow irritated when Lincoln would bring his children to the law office. Their father, it seemed, was often too absorbed in his work to notice his children's behavior. Herndon recounted, &quot;I have felt many and many a time that I wanted to wring their little necks, and yet out of respect for Lincoln I kept my mouth shut.

==Early career and militia service==
{{Further|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War}}
In 1832, Lincoln joined with a partner, [[Denton Offutt]], in the purchase of a general store on credit in New Salem.{{sfn|Winkle|2001|pp=72–79}} Although the economy was booming, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he entered politics, running for the [[Illinois General Assembly]], advocating navigational improvements on the [[Sangamon River]]. He could draw crowds as a [[raconteur]], but he lacked the requisite formal education, powerful friends, and money, and lost the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hN7QQgAACAAJ}}|title=Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln Volume 3 |chapter=The Improvement of Sangamon River|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|editor-first=Marion Mills |editor-last=Miller |year=1832|publisher=Wildside Press|isbn=9781434424976|language=en}} [[s:Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln/Volume 3/The Improvement of Sangamon River|WP article]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln briefly interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the [[Illinois Militia]] during the [[Black Hawk War]].{{sfn|Winkle|2001|pp=86–95}} When he returned to his campaign and first speech, he observed a supporter in the crowd under attack, grabbed the assailant by his &quot;neck and the seat of his trousers&quot; and tossed him.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=36}} Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.{{sfn|Winkle|2001|pp=114–116}}

Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, but continued his voracious reading, and he decided to become a lawyer. He taught himself the law, with [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Commentaries]]'', saying later of the effort, &quot;I studied with nobody.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=53–55}}

[[File:Abes House.JPG|thumb|left|Lincoln's home in [[Springfield, Illinois]]]]
Lincoln's second state house campaign in 1834, this time as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], was a success over a powerful Whig opponent.{{sfn|White|2009|p=59}} Then followed his four terms in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] for [[Sangamon County]].{{sfn|Simon|1990|p=283}} He championed construction of the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]], and later was a Canal Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/abraham-lincoln-in-depth/abraham-lincoln-and-internal-improvements/#imc|title=Abraham Lincoln and Internal Improvements|last=Weik|first=Jesse William|work=Abraham Lincoln's Classroom|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212045823/http://abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/abraham-lincoln-in-depth/abraham-lincoln-and-internal-improvements/#imc|archivedate=February 12, 2015|url-status=live|access-date=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males, but adopted a &quot;free soil&quot; stance opposing both slavery and [[abolitionism in the United States|abolition]].{{sfn|Simon|1990|p=130}} In 1837 he declared, &quot;[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=134}} He echoed [[Henry Clay]]'s support for the [[American Colonization Society]] which advocated a program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in [[Liberia]].{{sfn|Foner|2010|p=17–19, 67}}

True to his record, Lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be &quot;an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=222}} Their party favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund [[internal improvements]] including railroads, and urbanization.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=137–153}}

In 1843 Lincoln sought the Whig nomination for Illinois's 7th district seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]; he was defeated by [[John J. Hardin]] though he prevailed with the party in limiting Hardin to one term. Lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in 1846, but also won election. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but as dutiful as any, participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=79}} He was assigned to the [[United States House Committee on Post Office and Post Roads|Committee on Post Office and Post Roads]] and the [[United States House Committee on Expenditures in the War Department|Committee on Expenditures in the War Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Congressman Lincoln – Abraham Lincoln Historical Society|url=http://www.abraham-lincoln-history.org/us-congressman-lincoln/|publisher=Abraham-lincoln-history.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215191236/http://www.abraham-lincoln-history.org/us-congressman-lincoln/|archive-date=December 15, 2018|accessdate=February 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln teamed with [[Joshua R.

He dropped the bill when it eluded Whig support.{{sfnm|Harris|2007|1p=54|Foner|2010|2p=57}}

=== Political views ===
On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke against the [[Mexican–American War]], which he imputed to President [[James K. Polk]]'s desire for &quot;military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood&quot;.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2006|pp=181–183}} He supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]], a failed proposal to ban slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.{{sfn|Holzer|2004|p=63}}

Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his [[Spot Resolutions]]. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico, and Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had &quot;invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our soil&quot;.{{sfn|Oates|1974|pp=79–80}}{{Verify source|date=June 2020}} Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.{{sfn|Graebner|1959|pp=199–202}} The resolution was ignored in both Congress and the national papers, and it cost Lincoln political support in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him &quot;spotty Lincoln&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MuellerSchamel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/lincoln-resolutions/ |title=Lincoln's Spot Resolutions |publisher=National Archives |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920053345/http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/lincoln-resolutions/ |archivedate=September 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |access-date=March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on presidential war-making powers.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=128}}

Lincoln had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House. Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, he supported General [[Zachary Taylor]] for the Whig nomination in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=124–126}} Taylor won and Lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed Commissioner of the [[General Land Office]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=140}} The administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the [[Oregon Territory]] as consolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Isaac Newton |date=1885 |title=The Life of Abraham Lincoln |volume=2 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=3zgDAAAAYAAJ|page=81}} |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=Janses, McClurg, &amp; Company |page=81 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403025741/https://books.google.com/books?id=3zgDAAAAYAAJ |archivedate=April 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.{{sfn|Harris|2007|pp=55–57}}

==Prairie lawyer==
{{see also|List of cases involving Abraham Lincoln}}
[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Hesler, 1857.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lincoln in 1857]]
In his Springfield practice Lincoln handled &quot;every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=96}} Twice a year he appeared for 10 consecutive weeks in county seats in the midstate county courts; this continued for 16 years.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=105–106, 158}} Lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=142–143}} He later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a [[Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Company|landmark case]] involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=o30wBAAAQBAJ}}|title=Lincoln's Greatest Case: The River, the Bridge, and the Making of America|last=McGinty|first=Brian|date=February 9, 2015|publisher=W.

Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases; he was sole counsel in 51 cases, of which 31 were decided in his favor.{{sfn|Richards|2015|p=440}} From 1853 to 1860, one of his largest clients was the [[Illinois Central Railroad]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=155–156, 196–197}} His legal reputation gave rise to the nickname &quot;Honest Abe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5GJ6Un1JA_8C}}|title=The Wisdom of Abraham Lincoln|last=Library|first=Philosophical|date=November 9, 2010|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=978-1-4532-0281-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln argued in an 1858 criminal trial, defending [[William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=150–151}} The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by [[judicial notice]] to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'' showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Armstrong was acquitted.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=150–151}}

Leading up to his presidential campaign, Lincoln elevated his profile in an 1859 murder case, with his defense of Simeon Quinn &quot;Peachy&quot; Harrison who was a third cousin; Harrison was also the grandson of Lincoln's political opponent, [[Peter Cartwright (revivalist)|Rev. Peter Cartwright]].&lt;ref name= Harrison1935&gt;{{cite book|oclc=3512772|last=Harrison|first=J. Houston|title=Settlers by the Long Grey Trail|year=1935|publisher=J.K.

Lincoln argued that the testimony involved a [[dying declaration]] and was not subject to the hearsay rule. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence, resulting in Harrison's acquittal.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=150–151}}

===Emergence as Republican leader===
{{Further|Slave states and free states|Abraham Lincoln and slavery}}
[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Byers, 1858 - crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Lincoln in 1858, the year of [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|his debates]] with [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]] over slavery.]]

The debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North, with the failure of the [[Compromise of 1850]], a legislative package designed to address the issue.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=175–176}} In his 1852 eulogy for Clay, Lincoln highlighted the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to &quot;both extremes&quot; on the slavery issue.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=182–185}} As the slavery debate in the [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] and [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]] territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed [[Popular sovereignty in the United States#Emergence of the term &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; and its pejorative connotation|popular sovereignty]] as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the resulting spread of slavery, but Douglas's [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.{{sfn|White|2009|p=188–190}}

Lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his &quot;[[Abraham Lincoln's Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]]&quot; in October 1854. Lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=148–152}} He said the Kansas Act had a &quot;''declared'' indifference, but as I must think, a covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world&amp;nbsp;...&quot;{{sfn|Graebner|1959|p=255}} Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203–205}}

Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting on the demise of his party, Lincoln wrote in 1855, &quot;I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist...I do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery.&quot;{{sfn|White|2009|pp=215–216}} The new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery, drawing from the antislavery wing of the Whig Party, and combining [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]], [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty]], and antislavery [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] members,{{sfn|McGovern|2009|pp=38–39}} Lincoln resisted early Republican entreaties, fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203–204}} Lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the Whigs, though he lamented his party's growing closeness with the nativist [[Know Nothing]] movement.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=191–194}}

In 1854 Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature but declined to take his seat. The year's elections showed the strong opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and in the aftermath, Lincoln sought election to the United States Senate.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203–205}} At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=119}} After leading in the first six rounds of voting, he was unable to obtain a majority. Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for [[Lyman Trumbull]]. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, [[Joel Aldrich Matteson]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=205–208}}

==== 1856 campaign ====
[[Bleeding Kansas|Violent political confrontations in Kansas]] continued, and opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North. As the [[United States elections, 1856|1856 elections]] approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans and attended the [[Bloomington Convention]], which formally established the [[Illinois Republican Party]]. The convention platform endorsed Congress's right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the [[Lincoln's Lost Speech|final speech]] of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=216–221}} At the June [[1856 Republican National Convention]], though Lincoln received support to run as vice president, [[John C. Frémont]] and [[William Dayton]] comprised the ticket, which Lincoln supported throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Secretary of State [[James Buchanan]] and the Know-Nothings nominated former Whig President [[Millard Fillmore]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=224–228}} Buchanan prevailed, while Republican [[William Henry Bissell]] won election as Governor of Illinois, and Lincoln became a leading Republican in Illinois.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=229–230}}{{efn|[[Eric Foner]] contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast, who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans, who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the [[republicanism in the United States|republicanism principles]] of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|Foner|2010|pp=84–88}}}}
[[File:DredScott.jpg|alt=Painting|thumb|upright|A portrait of [[Dred Scott]], petitioner in ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'']]

==== ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' ====
[[Dred Scott]] was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a free territory under the Missouri Compromise. After Scott was returned to the slave state he petitioned a federal court for his freedom. His petition was denied in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857).{{Efn|While the name of the Supreme Court case is ''Dred Scott vs. Sandford'', the respondent's [[surname]] was actually &quot;Sanford&quot;.

Taney]] in the decision wrote that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution. While many Democrats hoped that ''Dred Scott'' would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=236–238}} Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the [[Slave Power]].{{sfn|Zarefsky|1993|pp=69–110}} He argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect, they believed all men were equal &quot;in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;.{{sfn|Jaffa|2000|pp=299–300}}

===Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech===
{{Further|Lincoln–Douglas debates|Cooper Union speech}}

In 1858 Douglas was up for re-election in the U.S. Senate, and Lincoln hoped to defeat him. Many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=247–248}} Some eastern Republicans supported Douglas from his opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]] and admission of Kansas as a [[slave state]].{{sfn|Oates|1974|pp=138–139}} Many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=247–250}}
[[File:Lincoln O-17 by Brady, 1860.png|thumb|left|Abraham Lincoln (1860) by [[Mathew Brady]], taken the day of the Cooper Union speech.]]
Accepting the nomination, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], with the biblical reference Mark 3:25, &quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot;{{sfn|White|2009|p=251}} The speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion.{{sfn|Harris|2007|p=98}} The stage was then set for the election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=209}} When informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated, &quot;[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party&amp;nbsp;... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won.&quot;{{sfn|White|2009|pp=257–258}}

The Senate campaign featured seven [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|debates]] between the two. These were the most famous political debates in American history; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=214–218}} The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that Douglas’ &quot;Slave Power&quot; was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the Founding Fathers' premise that [[all men are created equal]]. Douglas emphasized his [[Freeport Doctrine]], that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=214–224}} Lincoln's argument assumed a moral tone, as he claimed Douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery. Douglas's argument was more legal, claiming that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court in the ''Dred Scott'' decision.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=223}}

Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas. Lincoln's articulation of the issues gave him a national political presence.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|pp=89–90}} In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the ''Illinois Staats-Anzeiger'', a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=242, 412}} In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate, rivaled by [[William H. Seward]], [[Salmon P. Chase]], [[Edward Bates]], and [[Simon Cameron]]. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast, and was unsure whether to seek the office.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=291–293}} In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=307–308}}

On February 27, 1860, powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]], in which he argued that the [[List of national founders|Founding Fathers]] had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. He insisted that morality required opposition to slavery, and rejected any &quot;groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong&quot;.{{sfn|Jaffa|2000|p=473}} Many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly.{{sfn|Holzer|2004|pp=108–111}} But Lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention. Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, &quot;No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience.&quot;{{sfnm|Carwardine|2003|1p=97|Holzer|2004|2p=157}}

Historian [[David Herbert Donald]] described the speech as a &quot;superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's (Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (Chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=240}} In response to an inquiry about his ambitions, Lincoln said, &quot;The taste ''is'' in my mouth a little.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=241}}

On May 18, at the [[1860 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, [[Hannibal Hamlin]] of Maine, was nominated for vice president to [[Ticket balance|balance the ticket]]. Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff.{{sfn|Luthin|1944|pp=609–629}}
Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by the state's iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support.{{sfn|Hofstadter|1938|pp=50–55}} Lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln's dictate to &quot;Make no contracts that bind me&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=247–250}}

As the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government, most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=10, 13, 18}} When Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the [[1860 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]]; they opposed Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and selected incumbent Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]] as their candidate.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=253}} A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] and nominated [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of Tennessee.

Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the [[Wide Awakes]], which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties.&lt;ref name=Audacious&gt;{{cite book|title=Lincoln for President: An Unlikely Candidate, An Audacious Strategy, and the Victory No One Saw Coming|last=Chadwick|first=Bruce|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=2PQqZzyw4uAC|page=l49}}|pages=147–149|publisher=Sourcebooks|location=Naperville, Illinois|date=2009|accessdate=April 1, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402091121/https://books.google.com/books?id=2PQqZzyw4uAC&amp;pgpage=149|archivedate=April 2, 2017|isbn=978-1-4022-4756-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's ideas of abolishing [[slavery]] grew, drawing more supporters.

''Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People''. Belmont: Clark Baxter, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the power of &quot;free labor&quot;, which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=254–256}} The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a ''Chicago Tribune'' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000–200,000 copies.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=254}}

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president. He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.{{sfn|Mansch|2005|p=61}} Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race, carrying the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon.{{sfn|White|2009|p=350}} His victory in the [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] was decisive: Lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|p=4:312}}

===Secession and inauguration===
{{Main|Baltimore Plot}}
In response to Lincoln's election, secessionists implemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861.{{sfn|Edgar|1998|p=350}} On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1p=267|Potter|1977|p2=498}} Six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the [[Confederate States of America]], and adopted a constitution.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=267}} The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) initially rejected the secessionist appeal.{{sfn|White|2009|p=362}} President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal.{{sfn|Potter|1977|pp=520, 569–570}} The Confederacy selected [[Jefferson Davis]] as its provisional President on February 9, 1861.{{sfn|White|2009|p=369}}

Attempts at compromise followed but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected the proposed [[Crittenden Compromise]] as contrary to the Party's platform of free-soil in the [[Territories of the United States|territories]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=360–361}} Lincoln said, &quot;I will suffer death before I consent&amp;nbsp;... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=268}}

Lincoln tacitly supported the [[Corwin Amendment]] to the Constitution, which passed Congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when Lincoln took office. That doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed.{{sfnm|Vorenberg|2001|1p=22|Vile|2003|2pp=280–281}} A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution.{{sfn|Lupton|2006|p=34}}

[[File:Abraham lincoln inauguration 1861.jpg|thumb|alt=A large crowd in front of a large building with many pillars.|March 1861 inaugural at the [[U.S. Capitol Building|Capitol building]]. [[United States Capitol dome|The dome]] above the rotunda was still under construction.]]

En route to his inauguration, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=273–277}} The president-elect evaded suspected [[Baltimore Plot|assassins in Baltimore]]. On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=277–279}} Lincoln directed [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|his inaugural address]] to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the Southern states:
{{quote|Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that &quot;I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.&quot;|[[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|First inaugural address]], 4 March 1861{{sfn|Sandburg|2002|p=212}}|source=}} Lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between North and South, stating &quot;One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute.&quot; The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: &quot;We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies&amp;nbsp;... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=283–284}} The failure of the [[Peace Conference of 1861]] signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=268, 279}} Later in his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]] Lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said: &quot;Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.&quot;

===The Civil War===

[[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Major Robert Anderson]], commander of the Union's [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston, South Carolina, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] and began the fight. Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and overlooking Southern Unionist opposition to an invasion.{{sfn|Nevins|1959|p=5:29}}

[[William Tecumseh Sherman]] talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; at his failure to realize that &quot;the country was sleeping on a volcano&quot; and that the South was preparing for war.{{sfn|Sherman|1990|pp=185–186}} Donald concludes that, &quot;His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=293}}

On April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and &quot;preserve the Union&quot;, which, in his view, remained intact despite the seceding states. This call forced states to choose sides. Virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] as the Confederate capital, despite its exposure to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas followed over the following two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky remained neutral.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=226}} The Fort Sumter attack rallied Americans north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to defend the nation.

As States sent Union regiments south, on April 19, Baltimore mobs in control of the rail links [[Baltimore riot of 1861|attacked Union troops]] who were changing trains. Local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the Army responded by arresting [[Maryland in the American Civil War#Imposition of martial law|local Maryland]] officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States#Suspension during the Civil War|habeas corpus]]'' where needed for the security of troops trying to reach Washington.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|Coles|2002|p=174}} [[John Merryman]], one Maryland official hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney to issue a writ of ''habeas corpus.'' In June Taney, ruling only for the lower circuit court in [[ex parte Merryman]], issued the writ which he felt could only be suspended by Congress. Lincoln persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas.{{sfn|Harris|2011|1pp=59–71|Neely Jr.|1992|2pp=3–31}}

====Union military strategy====
Lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] military strategy. He responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as [[commander-in-chief]] by exercising unprecedented authority. He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln gained the support of Congress and the northern public for these actions. Lincoln also had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=303–304|Carwardine|2003|2pp=163–164}}

Seward|William Seward]], [[Gideon Welles]], Lincoln, and others]]

It was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success, and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery. The Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=315–339, 417}} On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861|Confiscation Act]] that authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederates. The law had little practical effect, but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1p=314|Carwardine|2003|2p=178}}

In August 1861, General John C. Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, without consulting Washington, issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels. Lincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as politically motivated and lacking military necessity.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=314–317}} As a result, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|p=181}}

Internationally, Lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the Confederacy.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=213–214}} He relied on his combative Secretary of State [[William Seward]] while working closely with [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] chairman [[Charles Sumner]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=322}} In the 1861 [[Trent Affair]] which threatened war with Great Britain, the U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the ''Trent'', on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer [[James G. Randall]] dissected Lincoln's successful techniques:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James Garfield|last= Randall|title=Lincoln the President: Springfield to Gettysburg|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=Vi8aAQAAIAAJ|page=50}}|year=1946|page=50|access-date=May 16, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122025358/https://books.google.com/books?id=Vi8aAQAAIAAJ|archivedate=November 22, 2016|isbn=978-0-306-80754-1}} quoted in Kevin Peraino, ''Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power'' (2013) pp 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|his restraint, his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence, his early softening of State Department's attitude toward Britain, his deference toward Seward and Sumner, his withholding of his paper prepared for the occasion, his readiness to arbitrate, his golden silence in addressing Congress, his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted, and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for America's true position at the same time that satisfaction was given to a friendly country.}}

Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the War Department. He tracked all phases of the effort, consulting with governors, and selecting generals based on their success, their state, and their party. In January 1862, after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced [[United States Secretary of War|War Secretary]] Simon Cameron with [[Edwin Stanton]]. Stanton centralized the War Department's activities, auditing and canceling contracts, saving the federal government $17,000,000.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=115}} Stanton was a staunch Unionist, pro-business, conservative Democrat who gravitated toward the Radical Republican faction. He worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official. &quot;Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together&quot;, say Thomas and Hyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WTGTAAAAIAAJ|page=385}}|title=Stanton: The Life and Times of Lincoln's Secretary of War|last=Thomas|first=Benjamin Platt|last2=Hyman|first2=Harold Melvin|date=1962|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|language=en|pp= 71, 87, 229–30, 385 (quote)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's war strategy embraced two priorities: ensuring that Washington was well-defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt, decisive victory.{{efn|Major Northern newspapers, however, demanded more—they expected victory within 90 days.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=295–296}}}} Twice a week, Lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon. Occasionally Mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride, concerned that he was working too hard.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=391–392}} For his edification Lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff General [[Henry Halleck]] entitled ''Elements of Military Art and Science''; Halleck was a disciple of the European strategist [[Antoine-Henri Jomini]]. Lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the [[Mississippi River]].{{sfn|Ambrose|1996|pp=7, 66, 159}} Lincoln saw the importance of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=432–436}}

====General McClellan====
After the Union rout at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]] and [[Winfield Scott]]'s retirement, Lincoln appointed Major General [[George B. McClellan]] general-in-chief.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=318–319}} McClellan then took months to plan his Virginia [[Peninsula Campaign]]. McClellan's slow progress frustrated Lincoln, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. McClellan, in turn, blamed the failure of the campaign on Lincoln's reservation of troops for the capitol.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=349–352}}

[[File:Lincoln and McClellan 1862-10-03.jpg|alt=Photograph of Lincoln and McClellan sitting at a table in a field tent|thumb|Lincoln and McClellan]]
In 1862 Lincoln removed McClellan for the general's continued inaction. He elevated Henry Halleck in July and appointed [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.battlefields.org/learn/biographies/henry-w-halleck|title=Henry W. Halleck|date=June 15, 2011|website=American Battlefield Trust|access-date=October 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008062810/https://www.battlefields.org/learn/biographies/henry-w-halleck|archive-date=October 8, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope satisfied Lincoln's desire to advance on Richmond from the north, thus protecting Washington from counterattack.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|pp=159–162}} But Pope was then soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac back to defend Washington.{{sfn|Nevins|1959|pp=159–162}}

Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln restored him to command of all forces around Washington.{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|pp=478–479}} Two days after McClellan's return to command, General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s forces crossed the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland, leading to the [[Battle of Antietam]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|pp=478–480}} That battle, a Union victory, was among the bloodiest in American history; it facilitated Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January.{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|p=481}}

McClellan then resisted the president's demand that he pursue Lee's withdrawing army, while General [[Don Carlos Buell]] likewise refused orders to move the [[Army of the Ohio]] against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. Lincoln replaced Buell with [[William Rosecrans]]; and after the [[1862 and 1863 United States House of Representatives elections|1862 midterm elections]] he replaced McClellan with [[Ambrose Burnside]]. The appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on Lincoln's part.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=389–390}}

Burnside, against presidential advice, launched an offensive across the [[Rappahannock River]] and was [[Battle of Fredericksburg|defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg]] in December. Desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and only increased after Fredericksburg, so Lincoln replaced Burnside with [[Joseph Hooker]].{{sfnm|Nevins|1947|1pp=433–444|Donald|1996|2pp=429–431}}

In the 1862 midterm elections the Republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation, high taxes, rumors of corruption, suspension of ''habeas corpus'', [[Conscription|military draft law]], and fears that freed slaves would come North and undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation gained votes for Republicans in rural New England and the upper Midwest, but cost votes in the Irish and German strongholds and in the lower Midwest, where many Southerners had lived for generations.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|p=322}}

In the spring of 1863 Lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near; the plans included attacks by Hooker on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga, [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=422–423}}

Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May, then resigned and was replaced by [[George Meade]].{{sfn|Nevins|1947|pp=432–450}} Meade followed Lee north into Pennsylvania and beat him in the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], but then failed to follow up despite Lincoln's demands. At the same time, Grant captured Vicksburg and gained control of the Mississippi River, splitting the far western rebel states.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=444–447}}

The Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865 delegated the issue to the individual states. Lincoln argued that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented. He sought to persuade the states to agree to [[compensated emancipation|compensation]] for emancipating their slaves in return for their acceptance of abolition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackubin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp |title=The Liberator |first=Thomas Owens |last=Mackubin |date=March 25, 2004 |work=National Review |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216125903/http://old.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp |archivedate=February 16, 2012 |url-status=live |access-date=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln rejected Fremont's two emancipation attempts in August 1861, as well as one by Major General [[David Hunter]] in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and would upset loyal border states.{{sfn|Guelzo|1999|pp=290–291}}

In June 1862, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory, which Lincoln signed. In July, the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]] was enacted, providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion; Lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional. He felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commander-in-chief, which he planned to exercise. Lincoln at this time reviewed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=364–365}}

Privately, Lincoln concluded that the Confederacy's slave base had to be eliminated. Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification; Republican editor [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''New York Tribune'' agreed.{{sfn|McPherson|1992|p=124}} In a letter of August 22, 1862, Lincoln said that while he personally wished all men could be free, regardless of that, his first obligation as president was to preserve the Union:{{sfn|Guelzo|2004|pp=147–153}}

{{quote|My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union&amp;nbsp;... [¶] I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.{{sfn|Graebner|1959|p=388}}}}

The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and effective January 1, 1863, affirmed the freedom of slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas under such control.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=364, 379}} Lincoln's comment on signing the Proclamation was: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=407}} He spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites.&lt;ref&gt;Louis P. Masur. (2012). ''Lincoln's Hundred Days: The Emancipation Proclamation and the War for the Union.'' Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective, Union armies advancing south liberated three million slaves.

Enlisting former slaves became official policy. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to Tennessee military governor [[Andrew Johnson]] encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, &quot;The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=430–431}} By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General [[Lorenzo Thomas]] had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=431}}

The Proclamation included Lincoln's earlier plans for [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] for newly freed slaves, though that undertaking ultimately failed.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=408}}

{{Main|Gettysburg Address}}
[[File:Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, Gettysburg, highlighted version.png|thumb|Lincoln, absent his usual top hat, is highlighted at Gettysburg.|alt=Large group of people]]
Lincoln spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=453–460}} In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal&quot;. He defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end, and the future of democracy would be assured, that &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth&quot;.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=460–466|Wills|2012|2pp=20, 27, 105, 146}}

Defying his prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here&quot;, the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.{{sfn|Bulla|Borchard|2010|p=222}}

Grant's victories at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and in the [[Vicksburg campaign]] impressed Lincoln. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, &quot;I can't spare this man. He fights.&quot;{{sfn|Thomas|2008|p=315}} With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could advance in multiple theaters, while also including black troops. Meade's failure to capture Lee's army after Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme commander. Grant then assumed command of Meade's army.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|pp=4:6–17}}

Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864. He arranged for an intermediary to inquire into Grant's political intentions, and once assured that he had none, Lincoln promoted Grant to the newly revived rank of Lieutenant General, a rank which had been unoccupied since [[George Washington]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=490–492}} Authorization for such a promotion &quot;with the advice and consent of the Senate&quot; was provided by a new bill which Lincoln signed the same day he submitted Grant's name to the Senate. His nomination was confirmed by the Senate on March 2, 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/grant|title=Message of President Abraham Lincoln Nominating Ulysses S. Grant to Be Lieutenant General of the Army|date=August 15, 2016|website=National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant in 1864 waged the bloody [[Overland Campaign]], which exacted heavy losses on both sides.{{sfn|McPherson|2009|p=113}} When Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, the persistent general replied, &quot;I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=501}} Grant's army moved steadily south. Lincoln traveled to Grant's headquarters at [[City Point, Virginia]] to confer with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehousehistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html |title=The Peacemakers |publisher=The White House Historical Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927000627/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |access-date=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln reacted to Union losses by mobilizing support throughout the North.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=422–424}} Lincoln authorized Grant to target infrastructure—plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to weaken the South's morale and fighting ability. He emphasized defeat of the Confederate armies over destruction (which was considerable) for its own sake.{{sfn|Neely Jr.|2004|pp=434–458}} Lincoln's engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in 1864 when Confederate general [[Jubal Early]] [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raided Washington, D.C.]]. While Lincoln watched from an exposed position, Captain [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] shouted at him, &quot;Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!&quot;{{sfn|Thomas|2008|p=434}}

As Grant continued to weaken Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President [[Alexander H. Stephens|Stephens]] led a group meeting with Lincoln, Seward, and others at [[Hampton Roads Conference|Hampton Roads]]. Lincoln refused to negotiate with the Confederacy as a coequal; his objective to end the fighting was not realized.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=565}} On April 1, 1865, Grant nearly encircled Petersburg in a siege. The Confederate government evacuated Richmond and Lincoln visited the conquered capital. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]], officially ending the war.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=589}}

Lincoln ran for reelection in 1864, while uniting the main Republican factions, along with [[War Democrats]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]] and Andrew Johnson. Lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers—greatly expanded from peacetime—to build support and fend off the Radicals' efforts to replace him.{{sfnm|Fish|1902|1pp=53–69|Tegeder|1948|2pp=77–90}} At its convention, the Republicans selected Johnson as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new [[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=494–507}}

Grant's bloody stalemates damaged Lincoln's re-election prospects, and many Republicans feared defeat. Lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House;{{sfn|Grimsley|Simpson|2001|p=80}} Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope. The pledge read as follows:{{quote|&quot;This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, Memorandum concerning his probable failure of re-election, August 23, 1864. ''Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln'' (1953), vol. 7, p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Democratic platform followed the &quot;Peace wing&quot; of the party and called the war a &quot;failure&quot;; but their candidate, McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Meanwhile, Lincoln emboldened Grant with more troops and Republican party support. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and [[David Farragut]]'s capture of Mobile ended defeatism.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=531}} The Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. The National Union Party was united by Lincoln's support for emancipation. State Republican parties stressed the [[perfidy]] of the Copperheads.{{sfn|Randall|Current|1955|p=307}} On November 8, Lincoln carried all but three states, including 78 percent of Union soldiers.{{sfnm|1a1=Grimsley|1a2=Simpson|1y=2001|1p=80|2a1=Paludan|2y=1994|2pp=274–293}}

[[File:Abraham Lincoln second inaugural address.jpg|thumb|alt=A large crowd in front of a large building with many pillars|Lincoln's second inaugural address in 1865 at the almost completed Capitol building]]
On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address. In it, he deemed the war casualties to be God's will. Historian [[Mark Noll]] places the speech &quot;among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world;&quot; it is inscribed in the [[Lincoln Memorial]].{{sfn|Noll|2002|p=426}} Lincoln said:

{{quote|Fondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the [[wikt:bondman|bond-man's]] 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said, &quot;the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether&quot;. With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, Abraham ''Abraham Lincoln: Selected Speeches and Writings'' (Library of America edition, 2009) p 450&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction era}}
Reconstruction preceded the war's end, as Lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation, and the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates were to be treated, Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy.&quot;{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=509–512}} Lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states. His main goal was to keep the union together, so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forged in Crisis: The Making of Five Legendary Leaders|last=Koehn|first=Nancy|publisher=Scribner|year=2017|isbn=978-1-5011-7444-5|location=NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln led the moderates in Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radicals, under Rep. [[Thaddeus Stevens]], Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]], who otherwise remained Lincoln's allies. Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office and had not mistreated Union prisoners, if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=471–472}}

[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|A political cartoon of Vice President Andrew Johnson (a former tailor) and Lincoln, 1865, entitled ''The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union''. The caption reads (Johnson): &quot;Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever.&quot; (Lincoln): &quot;A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended.&quot;]]

As Southern states fell, they needed leaders while their administrations were restored. In Tennessee and Arkansas, Lincoln respectively appointed Johnson and [[Frederick Steele]] as military governors. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed, and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery. Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. The Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the 1864 [[Wade–Davis Bill]], which Lincoln vetoed. The Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=485–486}}

Lincoln's appointments were designed to harness both moderates and Radicals. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the Radicals' choice, Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|p=4:206}}

After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment. He declared that such an amendment would &quot;clinch the whole matter&quot; and by December 1863 an amendment was brought to Congress.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=561}} This first attempt fell short of the required two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Passage became part of the Republican/Unionist platform, and after a House debate the second attempt passed on January 31, 1865.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=562–563|History.com}} With ratification, it became the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] on December 6, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Primary Documents in American History: 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html |publisher=Library of Congress |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010110013/http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html |archivedate=October 10, 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed Senator Charles Sumner's [[Freedmen's Bureau]] bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves. The law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln announced a Reconstruction plan that involved short-term military control, pending readmission under the control of southern Unionists.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|pp=242–243}}

Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly how Reconstruction would have proceeded had Lincoln lived. Biographers James G. Randall and [[Richard Current]], according to David Lincove, argue that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lincove|first=David A.|title=Reconstruction in the United States: An Annotated Bibliography|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=3EQcT7-Dpi0C|page=80}}|year= 2000|publisher=Greenwood|page=80|access-date=June 27, 2015|isbn=978-0-313-29199-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It is likely that had he lived, Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson's, that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson's mistakes.}}

[[Eric Foner]] argues that:{{sfn|Foner|2010|p=335}}
{{quote|Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates. But time and again during the war, Lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans.&amp;nbsp;... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves&amp;nbsp;... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death.}}

===Native American policy===
Lincoln's experience with Indians followed the death of his grandfather Abraham at their hands, in the presence of his father and uncles. Lincoln claimed Indians were antagonistic toward his father, Thomas Lincoln, and his young family. Although Lincoln was a veteran of the Black Hawk War, which was fought in Wisconsin and Illinois in 1832, he saw no significant action.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=3}} During his presidency, Lincoln's policy toward Indians was driven by politics.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=3}} He used the Indian Bureau as a source of patronage, making appointments to his loyal followers in Minnesota and Wisconsin.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=4}} He faced difficulties guarding Western settlers, railroads, and telegraphs, from Indian attacks.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=4}}

On August 17, 1862, the [[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux Uprising]] in Minnesota, supported by the [[Yankton Sioux Tribe|Yankton Indians]], killed hundreds of white settlers, forced 30,000 from their homes, and deeply alarmed the Lincoln administration.{{sfn|Bulla|Borchard|2010|p=480}} Some believed it was a conspiracy by the Confederacy to launch a war on the Northwestern front.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|pp=4–5,7}} Lincoln sent General John Pope, the former head of the Army of Virginia, to Minnesota as commander of the new [[Department of the Northwest]].{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=7}} Lincoln ordered thousands of Confederate prisoners of war sent by railroad to put down the Sioux Uprising.{{sfnm|Burlingame|2008|1p=481|Nichols|1974|2p=7}} When the Confederates protested turning ''POWs'' into Indian fighters, Lincoln revoked the policy.{{sfn|Bulla|Borchard|2010|p=481}} Pope fought against the Indians mercilessly, even advocating their extinction. He ordered Indian farms and food supplies be destroyed, and Indian warriors be killed.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=7}} Aiding Pope, Minnesota Congressman Col. [[Henry Hastings Sibley|Henry H. Sibley]] led militiamen and regular troops to defeat the Sioux at [[Battle of Wood Lake|Wood Lake]].{{sfn|Bulla|Borchard|2010|p=481}} By October 9, Pope considered the uprising to be ended; hostilities ceased on December 26.{{sfn|Nichols|1974|p=8}}

Lincoln personally reviewed each of 303 execution warrants for [[Sioux#Santee (Isáŋyathi or Eastern Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] convicted of killing innocent farmers; he approved 39 for execution (one was later reprieved).{{sfn|Cox|2005|p=182}} Former Governor of Minnesota [[Alexander Ramsey]] told Lincoln, in 1864, that he would have gotten more presidential election support had he executed all 303 of the Indians. Lincoln responded, &quot;I could not afford to hang men for votes.&quot;{{sfn|Bulla|Borchard|2010|p=483}}

===Other enactments===

In the selection and use of his cabinet, Lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency. Lincoln commented on his thought process, “We need the strongest men of the party in the Cabinet. We needed to hold our own people together. I had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men. Then I had no right to deprive the country of their services.” {{sfn|Goodwin|2005|p=319}} Goodwin described the group in her biography as a ''[[Team of Rivals]]''.{{sfn|Goodwin|2005}}

Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to Congress' responsibility for legislating. Lincoln vetoed only four bills, particularly the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh Reconstruction program.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=137}} The [[1862 Homestead Act]] made millions of acres of Western government-held land available for purchase at low cost. The 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] provided government grants for [[List of agricultural universities and colleges|agricultural colleges]] in each state. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869.{{sfn|Paludan|1994|p=116}} The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was enabled by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.{{sfn|McPherson|2009|pp=450–452}}

There were two measures passed to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a [[Income tax in the United States|Federal income tax]]. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third [[Morrill Tariff]]s, following the first enacted by Buchanan. He also signed the [[Revenue Act of 1861]], creating the first U.S. income tax—a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|800|1861|r=-2}}}} in current dollar terms).{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=424}} The [[Revenue Act of 1862]] adopted rates that increased with income.{{sfn|Paludan|1994|p=111}}

Lincoln presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in other areas. The [[National Banking Act]] created the system of national banks. The US issued paper currency for the first time, known as [[Greenback (1860s money)|greenbacks]]—printed in green on the reverse side.&lt;ref&gt;Brands 2011, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, Congress created the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=424}}

In response to rumors of a renewed draft, the editors of the ''[[New York World]]'' and the ''[[The Journal of Commerce|Journal of Commerce]]'' published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market. Lincoln attacked the media for such behavior, and ordered a military seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=501–502}}

Lincoln is largely responsible for the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=471}} Thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in New England in the 17th century. It had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates. The prior proclamation had been during [[James Madison]]'s presidency 50 years earlier. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=471}}

In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as [[Yosemite National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaffer|first=Jeffrey P.|title=Yosemite National Park: A Natural History Guide to Yosemite and Its Trails|publisher=Wilderness Press|page=48|location=Berkeley|year=1999|isbn=978-0-89997-244-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's philosophy on court nominations was that &quot;we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=471}} Lincoln made five appointments to the Supreme Court. [[Noah Haynes Swayne]] was an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. [[Samuel Freeman Miller]] supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis was Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in the Illinois court circuit where Lincoln practiced. Democrat [[Stephen Johnson Field]], a previous California Supreme Court justice, provided geographic and political balance. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, became Chief Justice. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.{{sfn|Blue|1987|p=245}}

[[John Wilkes Booth]] was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=586–587}} After attending an April 11, 1865 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth hatched a plot to assassinate the President.{{sfn|Harrison|2010|pp=3–4}} Learning of the Lincolns' intent to attend a play with Grant, Booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at [[Ford's Theatre]], and to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their respective homes. Lincoln and wife attended the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' on the evening of April 14, just five days after Lee's surrender. At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=594–597}}

At 10:14&amp;nbsp;pm, Booth entered the back of Lincoln's theater box, crept up from behind, and fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. Lincoln's guest Major [[Henry Rathbone]] momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1p=597|Martin|2010}} Lincoln was taken across the street to [[Petersen House]].

Two weeks later, Booth was tracked to a farm in Virginia, and refusing to surrender, he was mortally shot by Sergeant [[Boston Corbett]] and died on April 26. Secretary Stanton had issued orders that Booth be taken alive, so Corbett was initially arrested for court martial. After a brief interview, Stanton declared him a patriot and dismissed the charge.{{sfnm|Steers Jr.|2010|1p=153|Donald|1996|2p=599}}

=== Funeral and burial ===
{{Main|Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln}}
The late President lay in state, first in the East Room of the White House, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. The caskets containing Lincoln's body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the ''Lincoln Special'' [[Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln#Funeral train|funeral train]].{{sfn|Trostel|2002|pp=31–58}} The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing{{sfnm|Trostel|2002|1pp=31–58|Goodrich|2005|2pp=231–238}} or in silent grief. Poet [[Walt Whitman]] composed ''[[When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd]]'' to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peck |first=Garrett |title=Walt Whitman in Washington, D.C.: The Civil War and America's Great Poet |year=2015 |publisher=The History Press |location=Charleston, SC |isbn=978-1-62619-973-6 |pages=118–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their [[Moses]]'.{{sfn|Hodes|2015|p=164}} In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war.{{sfn|Hodes|2015|pp=197–199}} Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death.{{sfn|Hodes|2015|pp=84, 86, 96–97}}

As a young man, Lincoln was a [[religious skepticism|religious skeptic]].{{sfnm|Carwardine|2003|1p=4|Wilson|1999|2p=84}} He was deeply familiar with the Bible, quoting and praising it.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=48–49, 514–515}} He was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/lincoln1|title=Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln. Volume 1.|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs.{{sfn|Noll|1992}} Through his entire public career, Lincoln had a proneness for quoting Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/faithquotes.htm|title=Religious Quotations by Abraham Lincoln|website=www.abrahamlincolnonline.org|access-date=March 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; His three most famous speeches -- [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|the House Divided Speech]], [[Gettysburg Address|the Gettysburg Address]], and [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address|his second inaugural]]—each contain direct allusions to Providence and quotes from Scripture.

In the 1840s, Lincoln subscribed to the [[The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated|Doctrine of Necessity]], a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=48–49}} With the death of his son Edward in 1850 he more frequently expressed a dependence on God.{{sfn|Parrillo|2000|pp=227–253}} He never joined a church, although he frequently attended [[First Presbyterian Church (Springfield, Illinois)|First Presbyterian Church]] with his wife beginning in 1852.{{sfn|White|2009|p=180}}{{efn|On claims that Lincoln was baptized by an associate of [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], see {{cite journal|url=http://www.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/1990s/vol_38_no_2_contents/martin.html |last=Martin |first=Jim |title=The secret baptism of Abraham Lincoln |journal=Restoration Quarterly |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=1996 |access-date=May 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019204330/http://www.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/1990s/vol_38_no_2_contents/martin.html |archivedate=October 19, 2012 }}}}

In the 1850s, Lincoln asserted his belief in &quot;providence&quot; in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=g9EynQEACAAJ}}|title=&quot;Our Country&quot;: Northern Evangelicals and the Union During the Civil War and Reconstruction|last=Brodrecht|first=Grant R.|date=2008|publisher=University of Notre Dame|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of son Willie in February 1862 may have caused him to look toward religion for solace.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|pp=251–254}} After Willie's death, he questioned the divine necessity of the war's severity. He wrote at this time that God &quot;could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun, He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.&quot;{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=254}}

Lincoln did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.{{sfn|Noll|1992}} By the end of the war, he increasingly appealed to the Almighty for solace and to explain events, writing on April 4, 1864, to a newspaper editor in Kentucky: &lt;blockquote&gt;I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it. Whither it is tending seems plain. If God now wills the removal of a great wrong, and wills also that we of the North as well as you of the South, shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong, impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/hodges.htm|title=Letter by Abraham Lincoln to Albert Hodges|website=www.abrahamlincolnonline.org|access-date=2020-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address, considered by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/09/lincolns-greatest-speech/306551/|title=Lincoln's Greatest Speech|last=Wills|first=Garry|date=September 1, 1999|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=March 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the greatest such address in American history, and by Lincoln himself as his own greatest speech, or one of them at the very least.{{efn|Lincoln wrote to Thurlow Weed on March 4, 1865, &quot;I except [my Second Inaugural] to wear as well as--''perhaps better than''--any thing I have ever produced.&quot;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/lincoln8|title=Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln.

=== Republican values ===
Lincoln's redefinition of ''[[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]'' has been stressed by historians such as [[John Patrick Diggins]], [[Harry V. Jaffa]], [[Vernon Burton]], Eric Foner, and Herman J. Belz.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|p=61}} Lincoln called the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]—which emphasized freedom and equality for all—the &quot;[[sheet anchor]]&quot; of republicanism beginning in the 1850s. He did this at a time when the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], which &quot;tolerated slavery&quot;, was the focus of most political discourse.{{sfnm|Jaffa|2000|1p=399|Thomas|2008|2p=61}} Diggins notes, &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself&quot; in the 1860 Cooper Union speech.{{sfnm|Diggins|1986|1p=307|Thomas|2008|2p=61}} Instead of focusing on the legality of an argument, he focused on the moral basis of republicanism.{{sfnm|Foner|2010|1p=215|Thomas|2008|2p=61}}

His position on war, though, was founded on a legal argument regarding the Constitution as essentially a contract among the states, and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract. Further, it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state.{{sfnm|Jaffa|2000|1p=263|Thomas|2008|2p=61}} Many soldiers and religious leaders from the north, though, felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=_zaSs2HzEEwC|page=243}}|title=The Age of Lincoln: A History|last=Burton|first=Orville Vernon|date=July 8, 2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=9781429939553|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, infrastructure improvements, and railroads, in opposition to [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian democrats]].{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=196–198, 229–231, 301}} [[William C.

Randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation &quot;in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform&quot;. Randall concludes that, &quot;he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.&quot;{{sfn|Randall|1962|p=175}}

In Lincoln's first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints. He said &quot;A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.&quot;{{sfn|Belz|1998|p=86}}

The successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people view the country. The term &quot;the United States&quot; has historically been used, sometimes in the plural (&quot;these United States&quot;), and other times in the singular. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Burt |first=Andrew |date=May 13, 2013 |title='These United States': How Obama's Vocal Tic Reveals a Polarized America |magazine=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/these-united-states-how-obamas-vocal-tic-reveals-a-polarized-america/275739/ |language=en-US |access-date=February 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's assassination left him a national martyr. He was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party.

Schwartz argues that Lincoln's American reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the [[Progressive Era]] (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of America's most venerated heroes, even among white Southerners. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Schwartz|2000|p=109}}

Union nationalism, as envisioned by Lincoln, &quot;helped lead America to the nationalism of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.&quot;{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|p=222}} In the [[New Deal]] era, liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the [[self-made man]] or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the [[welfare state]].{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=23, 91–98}}

Sociologist [[Barry Schwartz (sociologist)|Barry Schwartz]] argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with &quot;a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life&quot;. During the [[Great Depression]], he argues, Lincoln served &quot;as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful&quot;. Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, &quot;What would Lincoln do?&quot;{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=xi, 9, 24}} However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this &quot;fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness&quot;. He suggested that [[postmodernism]] and [[multiculturalism]] have diluted greatness as a concept.{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=xi, 9}}

In the [[Cold War]] years, Lincoln's image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by [[Communist]] regimes.{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=23, 91–98}} By the late 1960s, some African American intellectuals, led by [[Lerone Bennett Jr.]], rejected Lincoln's role as the Great Emancipator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Arthur|last=Zilversmit|title=Lincoln and the Problem of Race: A Decade of Interpretations|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0002.104/--lincoln-and-the-problem-of-race-a-decade-of-interpretations?rgn=main;view=fulltext|journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Association|location=Springfield, Illinois|volume=2|issue=1|date=1980|pages=22–24|access-date=December 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025185706/http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0002.104/--lincoln-and-the-problem-of-race-a-decade-of-interpretations?rgn=main;view=fulltext|archive-date=October 25, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John M.|last=Barr|title=Holding Up a Flawed Mirror to the American Soul: Abraham Lincoln in the Writings of Lerone Bennett Jr.|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0035.105/--holding-up-a-flawed-mirror-to-the-american-soul-abraham?keywords=rgn...;rgn=main;view=fulltext|journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Association|location=Springfield, Illinois|volume=35|issue=1|date=Winter 2014|pages=43–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] in 1968.{{sfn|Bennett Jr.|1968|pp=35–42}} He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks.

Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day;{{sfn|Dirck|2008|p=31}} and that he was a &quot;moral visionary&quot; who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.{{sfn|Striner|2006|pp=2–4}} The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashin|1y=2002|1p=61|2a1=Kelley|2a2=Lewis|2y=2005|2p=228}}

'''Aristotle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ær|ɪ|s|t|ɒ|t|əl}};{{sfn|Collins English Dictionary}} {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀριστοτέλης}} ''Aristotélēs'', {{IPA-grc|aristotélɛːs|pron}}; 384–322&amp;nbsp;BC) was a Greek [[philosopher]] and [[polymath]] during the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]] in [[Ancient Greece]]. Taught by [[Plato]], he was the founder of the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]], the [[Peripatetic school]] of philosophy, and the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tradition. His writings cover many subjects including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[biology]], [[zoology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], [[theatre]], [[music]], [[rhetoric]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[economics]], [[politics]], and government. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. It was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual [[lexicon]], as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.

Little is known about his life. Aristotle was born in the city of [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]] in [[Northern Greece]]. His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined [[Plato's Academy]] in [[Athens]] and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ([[Circa|c.]] 347 BC).{{sfn|Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.)}} Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip II of Macedon]], tutored [[Alexander the Great]] beginning in 343 BC.{{sfn|Russell| 1972}} He established a library in the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on [[papyrus]] [[scrolls]]. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication.{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=9}}

Aristotle's views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]] were developed. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], such as on the [[Hectocotylus|hectocotyl (reproductive) arm]] of the [[octopus]], were disbelieved until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as [[Peter Abelard]] and [[John Buridan]]. Aristotle's influence on logic also continued well into the 19th century.

He influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)|Islamic thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]], as well as [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as &quot;The First Teacher&quot; and among medieval Christians like [[Thomas Aquinas]] as simply &quot;The Philosopher&quot;. His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]], such as in the thinking of  [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Philippa Foot]].

In general, the details of Aristotle's life are not well-established. The biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.{{efn-ua | See{{harv|Shields|2012|pp=3–16}};{{harv|Düring|1957}} covers ancient biographies of Aristotle.}}

Aristotle, whose name means &quot;the best purpose&quot; in Ancient Greek,{{sfn|Campbell}}&lt;!--better source desirable--&gt; was born in 384&amp;nbsp;BC in [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]], [[Chalcidice]], about 55&amp;nbsp;km (34 miles) east of modern-day [[Thessaloniki]].{{sfn|McLeisch|1999|p=5}}{{sfn|Aristoteles-Park in Stagira}} His father [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]] was the personal physician to [[Amyntas III of Macedon|King Amyntas of Macedon]]. Both of Aristotle's parents died when he was about thirteen, and [[Proxenus of Atarneus]] became his guardian.{{sfn|Hall|2018|p=14}} Although little information about Aristotle's childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)#Kingship and the royal court|Macedonian monarchy]].{{sfn|Anagnostopoulos|2013|page=4}}

At the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]].{{sfn|Blits|1999|pp=58–63}} He probably experienced the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the Eleusinian Mysteries, &quot;to experience is to learn&quot; [παθείν μαθεĩν].{{sfn|Evans|2006}} Aristotle remained in Athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in 348/47&amp;nbsp;BC. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew [[Speusippus]], although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died.{{sfn|Aristotle|1984|pp=Introduction}} Aristotle then accompanied [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon. While in Lesbos, Aristotle married [[Pythias]], either Hermias's adoptive daughter or niece. She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor to his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].{{sfn|Shields|2016}}{{sfn|Russell|1972}}

[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg | thumb | upright | [[Bust (sculpture)|Portrait bust]] of Aristotle; an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] (1st or 2nd century AD) copy of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]]]]

Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of [[Macedon]]. During Aristotle's time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]].{{sfn|Green|1991|pp=58–59}} Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and Aristotle's own attitude towards [[Persia]] was unabashedly [[Ethnocentricism|ethnocentric]]. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be &quot;a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants&quot;.{{sfn|Green|1991|pp=58–59}} By 335&amp;nbsp;BC, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]]. According to the ''[[Suda]]'', he also had an ''[[eromenos|erômenos]]'', [[Palaephatus | Palaephatus of Abydus]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=88}}

This period in Athens, between 335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.{{sfn|Russell|1972}} He wrote many dialogues, of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[On the Soul]]'' and ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to &quot;logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance and theatre.&quot;{{sfn|Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.)}}

Near the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander's relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but the only evidence of this is an [[Hagnothemis|unlikely claim]] made some six years after the death.{{sfn|Green|1991|p=460}} Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322&amp;nbsp;BC, Demophilus and [[Eurymedon the Hierophant]] reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety,{{sfn|Filonik|2013|pp=72–73}} prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in [[Chalcis | Chalcis, on Euboea]], at which occasion he was said to have stated: &quot;I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy&quot;{{sfn|Jones|1980|p=216}}{{sfn|Gigon|2017|p=41}}{{sfn|Düring|1957|p=T44a-e}} – a reference to Athens's [[Trial of Socrates|trial and execution of Socrates]]. He died on Euboea of natural causes later that same year, having named his student [[Antipater]] as his chief [[executor]] and leaving a [[Will (law)|will]] in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.{{sfn|Haase|1992|p=3862}}

===Logic===
{{main | Term logic}}
{{details | Non-Aristotelian logic}}

With the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic,{{sfn| Degnan | 1994 | pp=81–89}} and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th-century advances in [[mathematical logic]].{{sfn| Corcoran | 2009 | pp=1–20}} [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] stated in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that with Aristotle logic reached its completion.{{sfn| Kant | 1787 | pages=Preface}}

What we today call ''Aristotelian logic'' with its [[Syllogism#Types|types of syllogism]] (methods of logical argument),{{sfn| Lagerlund | 2016}} Aristotle himself would have labelled &quot;analytics&quot;. The term &quot;logic&quot; he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the ''[[Organon]]'' around 40 BC by [[Andronicus of Rhodes]] or others among his followers.{{sfn| Pickover | 2009 | page=52}} The books are:
# ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]''
# ''[[On Interpretation]]''
# ''[[Prior Analytics]]''
# ''[[Posterior Analytics]]''
# ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]''
# ''[[On Sophistical Refutations]]''[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg | thumb | upright | [[Plato]] (left) and Aristotle in [[Raphael]]'s 1509 fresco, ''[[The School of Athens]]''. Aristotle holds his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and gestures to the earth, representing his view in immanent realism, whilst Plato gestures to the heavens, indicating his Theory of Forms, and holds his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.{{sfn| School of Athens}}{{sfn|Stewart|2019}}]]

The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the ''Categories,'' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in ''On Interpretation'', to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the ''Analytics''){{sfn| Prior Analytics | pp= 24b18–20}}{{sfn| Bobzien | 2015}} and dialectics (in the ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations''). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory ''stricto sensu'': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. The ''Rhetoric'' is not conventionally included, but it states that it relies on the ''Topics''.{{sfn| Smith | 2017}}

===Metaphysics===
{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}
The word &quot;metaphysics&quot; appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle's works to the treatise we know by the name ''Metaphysics''.{{sfn| Cohen | 2000}} Aristotle called it &quot;first philosophy&quot;, and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative (''theoretikē'') philosophy which is &quot;theological&quot; and studies the divine. He wrote in his ''Metaphysics'' (1026a16):

{{quote | if there were no other independent things besides the composite natural ones, the study of nature would be the primary kind of knowledge; but if there is some motionless independent thing, the knowledge of this precedes it and is first philosophy, and it is universal ''in just this way'', because it is first. And it belongs to this sort of philosophy to study being as being, both what it is and what belongs to it just by virtue of being.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1999 | page=111}}}}

==== Substance ====
{{see | Hylomorphism }}

Aristotle examines the concepts of [[Substance theory|substance]] (''ousia'') and [[essence]] (''to ti ên einai'', &quot;the what it was to be&quot;) in his ''Metaphysics'' (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called [[hylomorphism]]. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[Material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house, while the form of the substance is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=VIII 1043a 10–30}}{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}

===== Immanent realism =====
[[File:Platonic and Aristotelian Forms.svg | thumb | upright=1.6 | [[Plato]]'s [[Theory of forms|forms]] exist as [[universals]], like the ideal form of an apple. For Aristotle, both matter and form belong to the individual thing ([[hylomorphism]]).]]
{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}
Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Problem of universals|universal]]. Aristotle's [[ontology]] places the universal (''katholou'') in [[particular]]s (''kath' hekaston''), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate.  For Aristotle, &quot;form&quot; is still what [[phenomena]] are based on, but is &quot;instantiated&quot; in a particular substance.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}

Plato argued that all things have a [[Theory of forms|universal form]], which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyse a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but &quot;good&quot; is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the world of forms, a place where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}{{sfn| Lloyd | 1968 | pages=43–47}}

===== Potentiality and actuality =====
{{see | Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)}}

With regard to the change (''[[Potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' 319b–320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:

# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;
# locomotion, which is change in space; and
# alteration, which is change in quality.

[[File:Flute-player dolphin Alcesti Group MAN.jpg | thumb | Aristotle argued that a capability like playing the flute could be acquired – [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|the potential made actual]] – by learning.]]

The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if it is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}

{{quote | For that for the sake of which (''to hou heneka'') a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=IX 1050a 5–10}}}}

In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, &quot;what is it that makes a man one&quot;? Since, according to [[Plato]] there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=VIII 1045a–b}}

===Epistemology===
Aristotle's immanent realism means his [[epistemology]] is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these.{{sfn|Smith|2017}} Aristotle uses [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from examples alongside [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], whereas Plato relies on deduction from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles.{{sfn|Smith|2017}}

==Natural philosophy==

Aristotle's &quot;natural philosophy&quot; spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics, biology and other natural sciences.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}} In Aristotle's terminology, &quot;natural philosophy&quot; is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as &quot;science&quot;. Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term &quot;scientific method&quot;. For Aristotle, &quot;all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical&quot; (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.{{sfn|Wildberg|2016}}

====Five elements====
{{main | Classical element}}

In his ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by [[Empedocles]], [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Air (classical element)|Air]], and [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], to two of the four sensible qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry. In the Empedoclean scheme, all matter was made of the four elements, in differing proportions. Aristotle's scheme added the heavenly [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], the divine substance of the [[Celestial spheres|heavenly spheres]], stars and planets.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1968 | pages=133–39, 166–69}}

====Motion====
{{see | History of classical mechanics}}

Aristotle describes two kinds of motion: &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;unnatural motion&quot;, such as that of a thrown stone, in the ''Physics'' (254b10), and &quot;natural motion&quot;, such as of a falling object, in ''On the Heavens'' (300a20). In violent motion, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the motion stops also; in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest,{{sfn| Allain | 2016}}{{efn-ua | Rhett Allain notes that [[Newton's First Law]] is &quot;essentially a direct reply to Aristotle, that the natural state is ''not to change'' motion.{{sfn| Allain | 2016}}}} since Aristotle does not address [[friction]].{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60–84}} With this understanding, it can be observed that, as Aristotle stated, heavy objects (on the ground, say) require more force to make them move; and objects pushed with greater force move faster.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}{{efn-ua | Leonard Susskind comments that Aristotle had clearly never gone [[ice skating]] or he would have seen that it takes force to stop an object.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}}} This would imply the equation{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}

:: &lt;math&gt;F=mv&lt;/math&gt;,

incorrect in modern physics.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}

Natural motion depends on the element concerned: the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens,{{efn-ua | For heavenly bodies like the Sun, Moon, and stars, the observed motions are &quot;to a very good approximation&quot; circular around the Earth's centre, (for example, the apparent rotation of the sky because of the rotation of the Earth, and the rotation of the moon around the Earth) as Aristotle stated.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23–40}}}} while the 4 Empedoclean elements move vertically up (like fire, as is observed) or down (like earth) towards their natural resting places.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23–40}}{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60–84}}{{efn-ua | Drabkin quotes numerous passages from ''Physics'' and ''On the Heavens'' (''De Caelo'') which state Aristotle's laws of motion.{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60–84}}}}

[[File:Aristotle's laws of motion.svg | thumb | upright=1.5 | Aristotle's laws of motion. In ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' he states that objects fall at a speed proportional to their weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid they are immersed in.{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60–84}} This is a correct approximation for objects in Earth's gravitational field moving in air or water.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23–40}}]]

In the ''Physics'' (215a25), Aristotle effectively states a quantitative law, that the speed, v, of a falling body is proportional (say, with constant c) to its weight, W, and inversely proportional to the density,{{efn-ua | Drabkin agrees that density is treated quantitatively in this passage, but without a sharp definition of density as weight per unit volume.{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60–84}}}} ρ, of the fluid in which it is falling:{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23–40}}{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60–84}}

:: &lt;math&gt;v=c\frac{W}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

Aristotle implies that in a [[vacuum]] the speed of fall would become infinite, and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23–40}}{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60–84}} Opinions have varied on whether Aristotle intended to state quantitative laws. Henri Carteron held the &quot;extreme view&quot;{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60–84}} that Aristotle's concept of force was basically qualitative,{{sfn| Carteron | 1923 | pages=1–32 and passim}} but other authors reject this.{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60–84}}

[[Archimedes]] corrected Aristotle's theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places; metal boats can float if they [[Archimedes' principle|displace enough water]]; floating depends in Archimedes' scheme on the mass and volume of the object, not as Aristotle thought its elementary composition.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23–40}}

Aristotle's writings on motion remained influential until the [[Early Modern]] period. [[John Philoponus]] (in the [[Middle Ages]]) and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotle's claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}} A contrary opinion is given by [[Carlo Rovelli]], who argues that Aristotle's physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the [[Earth]]'s gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air. In this system, heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones (whether friction is ignored, or not{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23–40}}), and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}{{efn-ua | Philoponus and Galileo correctly objected that for the transient phase (still increasing in speed) with heavy objects falling a short distance, the law does not apply: Galileo used balls on a short incline to show this. Rovelli notes that &quot;Two heavy balls with the same shape and different weight do fall at different speeds from an aeroplane, confirming Aristotle's theory, not Galileo's.&quot;{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23–40}}}}

Newton's &quot;forced&quot; motion corresponds to Aristotle's &quot;violent&quot; motion with its external agent, but Aristotle's assumption that the agent's effect stops immediately it stops acting (e.g., the ball leaves the thrower's hand) has awkward consequences: he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it, resulting in the Medieval [[theory of impetus]].{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23–40}}

====Four causes====
{{main | Four causes}}
[[File:Aristotle's Four Causes of a Table.svg | thumb | upright=1.6 | Aristotle argued by analogy with woodwork that a thing takes its form from [[four causes]]: in the case of a table, the wood used ([[material cause]]), its design ([[formal cause]]), the tools and techniques used ([[efficient cause]]), and its decorative or practical purpose ([[final cause]]).{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=88–90}}]]

Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors. His term ''aitia'' is traditionally translated as &quot;cause&quot;, but it does not always refer to temporal sequence; it might be better translated as &quot;explanation&quot;, but the traditional rendering will be employed here.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96–100, 106–07}}{{sfn| Hankinson | 1998 | page=159}}
* [[Material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood. It is not about action. It does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96–100, 106–07}}
* The [[formal cause]] is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter. It tells us what a thing is, that a thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96–100, 106–07}}
* The [[efficient cause]] is &quot;the primary source&quot;, or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. In the case of two dominoes, when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96–100, 106–07}} In the case of animals, this agency is a combination of [[developmental biology|how it develops from the egg]], and [[physiology|how its body functions]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=91–92, 369–73}}
* The [[final cause]] (''telos'') is its purpose, the reason why a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96–100, 106–07}} In the case of living things, it implies [[adaptation]] to a particular way of life.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=91–92, 369–73}}

====Optics====
{{further | History of optics}}

Aristotle describes experiments in [[optics]] using a [[camera obscura]] in ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]]'', book 15. The apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small [[aperture]] that let light in. With it, he saw that whatever shape he made the hole, the sun's image always remained circular. He also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image.{{sfn| Lahanas}}

====Chance and spontaneity====
{{further | Accident (philosophy)}}

According to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental things]], &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot;. There is also more a specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names &quot;luck&quot;, that only applies to people's moral choices.{{sfn| Physics | p=2.6}}{{sfn| Miller | 1973 | pp=204–13}}

===Astronomy===
{{further | History of astronomy}}

In [[astronomy]], Aristotle refuted [[Democritus]]'s claim that the [[Milky Way]] was made up of &quot;those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,&quot; pointing out correctly that if &quot;the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.&quot;{{sfn| Meteorology | p=1. 8}}

[[File:DenglerSW-Stromboli-20040928-1230x800.jpg | thumb | Aristotle noted that the ground level of the [[Aeolian islands]] changed before a [[volcanic eruption]].]]

===Geology===
{{further | History of geology}}

Aristotle was one of the first people to record any [[geology|geological]] observations. He stated that [[Uniformitarianism|geological change]] was too slow to be observed in one person's lifetime.{{sfn| Moore | 1956 | page=13}}{{sfn| Meteorology | p=Book 1, Part 14}}
The geologist [[Charles Lyell]] noted that Aristotle described such change, including &quot;lakes that had dried up&quot; and &quot;deserts that had become watered by rivers&quot;, giving as examples the growth of the [[Nile delta]] since the time of [[Homer]], and &quot;the upheaving of one of the [[Aeolian islands]], previous to a [[volcanic eruption]].&quot;'{{sfn| Lyell | 1832 | page=17}}

===Biology===
{{main | Aristotle's biology}}
[[File:Tremoctopus violaceus5.jpg | thumb | upright | Among many pioneering zoological observations, Aristotle described the reproductive [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]] of the [[octopus]] (bottom left).]]

====Empirical research====

Aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically,{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=7}} and biology forms a large part of his writings. He spent two years observing and describing the zoology of [[Lesbos]] and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=14}}{{sfn| Thompson | 1910 | page=Prefatory Note}} His data in ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', ''[[Movement of Animals]]'', and ''[[Parts of Animals]]'' are assembled from his own observations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/darwins-ghosts-by-rebecca-stott-7808310.html|title=Darwin's Ghosts, By Rebecca Stott
|website=independent.co.uk|date=2 June 2012
|access-date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; statements given by people with specialized knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen, and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=196, 248}} His apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident: his works on [[botany]] have been lost, but two books on plants by his pupil Theophrastus have survived.{{sfn| Day | 2013 | pp=5805–16}}

Aristotle reports on the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and the catches of fishermen. He describes the [[catfish]], [[electric ray]], and [[frogfish]] in detail, as well as [[cephalopod]]s such as the [[octopus]] and [[paper nautilus]]. His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]] of cephalopods, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until the 19th century.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=66–74, 137}} He gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of [[ruminant]]s,{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=118–19}} and of the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=73}}

He notes that an animal's structure is well matched to function, so, among birds, the [[heron]], which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish, has a long neck and long legs, and a sharp spear-like beak, whereas [[duck]]s that swim have short legs and webbed feet.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=135–36}} [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], too, noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of [[evolution]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=206}} Aristotle's writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution, but while Aristotle was aware that new mutations or [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridizations]] could occur, he saw these as rare accidents. For Aristotle, accidents, like heat waves in winter, must be considered distinct from natural causes. He was thus critical of Empedocles's materialist theory of a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; origin of living things and their organs, and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results.{{sfn| Sedley | 2007 | page=189}} To put his views into modern terms, he nowhere says that different species can have a [[common descent|common ancestor]], or that one kind can [[speciation|change into another]], or that kinds can become [[extinction|extinct]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=273}}

====Scientific style====
[[File:Two of Aristotle's Growth Laws.svg | thumb | left | upright=1.4 | Aristotle inferred growth laws from his observations on animals, including that [[brood size]] decreases with body mass, whereas [[gestation]] period increases. He was correct in these predictions, at least for mammals: data are shown for mouse and elephant.]]

Aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense.{{sfn| Taylor | 1922 | page=42}} He used the ancient Greek term ''pepeiramenoi'' to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures like dissection.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=361–65}} In ''Generation of Animals'', he finds a fertilized hen's egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo's heart beating inside.{{sfn| Leroi | 2011}}{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=197–200}}

Instead, he practiced a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=365–68}}{{sfn| Taylor | 1922 | page=49}} This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as [[genomics]]. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=365–68}}

From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of [[biological rules|rules]] relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. [[Life expectancy|Lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]], and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, [[fecundity]] decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=408}}{{-}}

====Classification of living things====
{{further | Scala naturae}}
[[File:Scyliorhinus retifer embryo.JPG | thumb | Aristotle recorded that the [[embryo]] of [[Mustelus canis|&lt;!--a different species shown--&gt;a dogfish]] was attached by a cord to a kind of placenta (the [[yolk sac]]), like a higher animal; this formed an exception to the linear scale from highest to lowest.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=72–74}}]]

Aristotle distinguished about 500 species of [[animal]]s,{{sfn| Bergstrom | Dugatkin | 2012 | page=35}}{{sfn| Rhodes | 1974 | page=7}} arranging these in the ''History of Animals'' in a graded scale of perfection, a ''[[scala naturae]]'', with man at the top. His system had eleven grades of animal, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave [[viviparity|live birth]] to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs. Animals came above [[plant]]s, and these in turn were above minerals.{{sfn| Mayr | 1982 | pages=201–02}} see also:{{sfn| Lovejoy | 1976}} He grouped what the modern zoologist would call [[vertebrate]]s as the hotter &quot;animals with blood&quot;, and below them the colder [[invertebrate]]s as &quot;animals without blood&quot;. Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing ([[mammal]]s), and the egg-laying ([[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[fish]]). Those without blood were insects, crustacea (non-shelled – cephalopods, and [[crustacea|shelled]]) and the hard-shelled [[mollusc]]s ([[bivalve]]s and [[gastropod]]s). He recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a [[placenta]] like the tetrapods. To a modern biologist, the explanation, not available to Aristotle,&lt;!--Leroi | p= 113--&gt; is [[convergent evolution]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=111–19}} He believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes; this [[teleological]] view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design.{{sfn| Mason | 1979 | pp=43–44}}

===Psychology===

====Soul====
{{further | On the Soul}}
[[File:Aristotelian Soul.png | thumb | upright=1.5 | Aristotle proposed a three-part [[Soul#Aristotle|structure for souls]] of plants, animals, and humans, making humans unique in having all three types of soul.]]

Aristotle's [[psychology]], given in his treatise ''[[On the Soul]]'' (''peri psychēs''), posits three kinds of [[soul]] (&quot;psyches&quot;): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. The human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the ''[[Nous#Aristotle|nous]]'' (intellect) and ''logos'' (reason).{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=156–63}}

For Aristotle, the soul is the [[Hylomorphism#Body–soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).{{sfn| Shields | 2016}} In contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.{{sfn| Mason | 1979 | p=45}} Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].{{sfn| Guthrie | 2010 | p=348}}

====Memory====

According to Aristotle in ''On the Soul'', memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal &quot;appearance&quot; and an occurrence in the past.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=12}} In other words, a memory is a mental picture ([[wikt:phantasm|phantasm]]) that can be recovered. Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian '[[common sense]]', and thinking.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=61}}{{sfn| Carruthers | 2007 | p=16}}

Aristotle uses the term 'memory' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=25}}

Because Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To search for these impressions, people search the memory itself.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=30}} Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. If the chain of &quot;images&quot; is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=25}} Recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression.{{sfn| Carruthers | 2007 | p=19}} Only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=296}}

[[File:Aristotle Senses Perception Memory Dreams Action.svg | thumb | upright=2.3 | Senses, perception, memory, dreams, action in Aristotle's psychology. Impressions are stored in the [[sensorium]] (the heart), linked by his [[laws of association]] (similarity, contrast, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]]).]]

Aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]], described in his [[laws of association]]. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=259}}{{sfn | Sorabji | 2006 | p=54}}

====Dreams====
{{see | Dream#Classical history}}

Aristotle describes sleep in ''On Sleep and Wakefulness''.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115–18}} or of digestion,{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} so it is vital to the body.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115–18}} While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire, which is the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep,{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115–18}} albeit differently,{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} unless they are weary.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115–18}}

Dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115–18}} Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then look away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115–18}} However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience.{{sfn| Modrak | 2009 | pp=169–81}} During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} This leads the person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in nature.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405–23}} In ''De Anima'' iii 3, Aristotle ascribes the ability to create, to store, and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination, ''phantasia''.{{sfn| Shields | 2016}}

One component of Aristotle's theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences.{{sfn| Webb | 1990 | pages=174–84}} Aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences.{{sfn| Modrak | 2009 | pp=169–81}}

Aristotle's practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics, politics, economics, and rhetoric.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}}

===Just war theory===
Aristotelian [[just war theory]] is not well regarded in the present day, especially his view that warfare was justified to enslave &quot;natural slaves&quot;. In Aristotelian philosophy, the abolition of what he considers &quot;[[natural slavery]]&quot; would undermine civic [[freedom]]. The pursuit of freedom is inseparable from pursuing mastery over &quot;those who deserve to be slaves&quot;. According to ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle's Politics'' the targets of this aggressive warfare were non-Greeks, noting Aristotle's view that &quot;our poets say 'it is proper for Greeks to rule non-Greeks'&quot;.{{sfn|Deslauriers|Destrée|2013|pp=157-162}}

Aristotle generally has a favourable opinion of war, extolling it as a chance for [[virtue]] and writing that &quot;the leisure that accompanies peace&quot; tends to make people &quot;arrogant&quot;. War to &quot;avoid becoming enslaved to others&quot; is justified as self-defense. He writes that war &quot;compels people to be just and temperate&quot;, however, in order to be just &quot;war must be chosen for the sake of peace&quot; (with the exception of wars of aggression discussed above).{{sfn|Deslauriers|Destrée|2013|pp=157-162}}

===Ethics===

{{main | Aristotelian ethics}}

Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.{{sfn| Kraut | 2001}}

Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the ''[[De Anima|psuchē]]'' (''soul'') in accordance with reason (''[[logos]]''). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity (the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency{{sfn| Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.)}}) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as &quot;happiness&quot; or sometimes &quot;well being&quot;. To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''ēthikē'' ''[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]''), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence.{{sfn| Nicomachean Ethics | ps= &amp;nbsp;Book I. See for example chapter 7.}}

Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''[[phronesis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.{{sfn| Nicomachean Ethics | p= Book VI}}

===Politics===

{{main | Politics (Aristotle)}}

In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, &quot;for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part&quot;.{{sfn| Politics | pp=1253a19–24}} He also famously stated that &quot;man is by nature a political animal&quot; and also arguing that humanity's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality.{{sfn| Aristotle | 2009 | pages=320–21}} Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.{{sfn| Ebenstein | Ebenstein | 2002 | page=59}}

[[File:Aristotle's constitutions.svg | thumb|upright=1.7 | Aristotle's classifications of political constitutions]]

The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions as a political &quot;community&quot; or &quot;partnership&quot; (''koinōnia'')&lt;!-- (1252a1) --&gt;. The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability&lt;!-- (1280b29–31) --&gt;, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: &quot;The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together&lt;!-- (1281a1–3) --&gt;.&quot; This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of &quot;fear of violent death&quot; or its &quot;inconveniences.&quot;{{efn-ua | For a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and ''Politics'' see Polanyi, Karl (1957) &quot;Aristotle Discovers the Economy&quot; in ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi'' ed. G. Dalton, Boston 1971, 78–115.}}

In ''[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protrepticus]]'', the character 'Aristotle' states:{{sfn| Hutchinson | Johnson | 2015 | p=22}}

{{quote | For we all agree that the most excellent man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.{{sfn| Hutchinson | Johnson | 2015 | p=22}}}}

===Economics===
{{main | Politics (Aristotle)}}

Aristotle made substantial contributions to [[economics|economic thought]], especially to thought in the Middle Ages.{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20–24}} In ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', Aristotle addresses the city, [[property]], and [[trade]]. His response to criticisms of [[private property]], in [[Lionel Robbins]]'s view, anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists, as it related to the overall [[utility]] of social arrangements.{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20–24}} Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from [[human nature]]. In ''Politics'', Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of [[money]].{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20–24}} Money came into use because people became dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or [[silver]].{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16–28}}

Aristotle's discussions on [[retail]] and [[interest]] was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a [[profit (economics)|profit]]. It thus uses goods as a means to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the money itself, and not from its use.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16–28}}

Aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement. Money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them &quot;commensurable&quot;.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16–28}} He goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange, making it a sort of security. That is, &quot;if we do not want a thing now, we shall be able to get it when we do want it&quot;.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16–28}}

===Rhetoric and poetics===
[[File:Bénigne Gagneraux, The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods.jpg | thumb | upright=1.3 | ''The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods'' (1784) by [[Bénigne Gagneraux]]. In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle uses the tragedy ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus Tyrannus]]'' by [[Sophocles]] as an example of how the perfect tragedy should be structured, with a generally good protagonist who starts the play prosperous, but loses everything through some ''[[hamartia]]'' (fault).{{sfn| Kaufmann | 1968 | pages=56–60}}]]
{{main | Rhetoric (Aristotle) | Poetics (Aristotle)}}

Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience: ''[[ethos]]'' (an appeal to the speaker's character), ''[[pathos]]'' (an appeal to the audience's emotion), and ''[[logos]]'' (an appeal to logical reasoning).{{sfn| Garver | 1994 | pages=109–10}} He also categorizes rhetoric into three genres: [[epideictic]] (ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame), [[Forensic rhetoric|forensic]] (judicial speeches over guilt or innocence), and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] (speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue).{{sfn| Rorty | 1996 | pages=3–7}} Aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical [[Proof (truth)|proofs]]: ''[[enthymeme]]'' (proof by [[syllogism]]) and ''[[paradeigma]]'' (proof by example).{{sfn| Grimaldi | 1998 | p=71}}

Aristotle writes in his ''Poetics'' that [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]], painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of ''[[mimesis]]'' (&quot;imitation&quot;), each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152–59}}{{sfn| Poetics | p= I 1447a}} He applies the term ''mimesis'' both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist's intention{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152–59}} and contends that the audience's realisation of the ''mimesis'' is vital to understanding the work itself.{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152–59}} Aristotle states that ''mimesis'' is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152–59}}{{sfn| Poetics | p= IV}} and that all human artistry &quot;follows the pattern of nature&quot;.{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152–59}} Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what [[Stephen Halliwell (academic)|Stephen Halliwell]] calls &quot;highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes.&quot;{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152–59}} For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.{{sfn| Poetics | p=III}}

While it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' originally comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.{{sfn| Poetics | p=VI}} The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.{{sfn| Poetics | p=XXVI}} Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].{{sfn| Aesop | 1998 | pages=Introduction, xi–xii}}

===Views on women===
{{main | Aristotle's views on women}}
{{further | Aristotle's biology#Inheritance}}

Aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. On this ground, proponents of [[feminist metaphysics]] have accused Aristotle of [[misogyny]]{{sfn| Freeland | 1998}} and [[sexism]].{{sfn| Morsink | 1979 | pp=83–112}} However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his ''Rhetoric'' that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men.{{efn-ua | &quot;Where, as among the Lacedaemonians, the state of women is bad, almost half of human life is spoilt.&quot;{{sfn| Rhetoric | p=Book I, Chapter 5}}}}

==Influence==
{{see | List of writers influenced by Aristotle}}

More than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | p=8}}{{sfn| Aristotle's Influence | 2018}} He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher [[Bryan Magee]], &quot;it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did&quot;.{{sfn| Magee | 2010 | page=34}} Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of [[formal logic]],{{sfn| Guthrie | 1990 | page=156}}&lt;!--{{sfn| Case | p=518}}--&gt; pioneered the study of [[zoology]], and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.{{sfn| Aristotle (Greek philosopher)}}{{sfn| Durant | 2006 | page=92}}{{sfn| Kukkonen | 2010 | pages=70–77}} Taneli Kukkonen, writing in ''The Classical Tradition'', observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched, and his reach in influencing &quot;every branch of intellectual enterprise&quot; including Western ethical and political theory, theology, rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long. As a result, Kukkonen argues, any analysis of reality today &quot;will almost certainly carry Aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind.&quot;{{sfn| Kukkonen | 2010 | pages=70–77}} [[Jonathan Barnes]] wrote that &quot;an account of Aristotle's intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought&quot;.{{sfn| Barnes | 1982 | page=86}}

Aristotle's pupil and successor, [[Theophrastus]], wrote the ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|History of Plants]]'', a pioneering work in botany. Some of his technical terms remain in use, such as [[carpel]] from ''carpos'', fruit, and [[pericarp]], from ''pericarpion'', seed chamber.{{sfn| Hooker | 1831 | page=219}}
Theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than Aristotle was, instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned.{{sfn| Mayr | 1982 | pp= 90–91}}{{sfn| Mason | 1979 | p= 46}}

===On later Greek philosophers===
{{further | Peripatetic school}}

The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the [[Peripatetic school]]. Aristotle's notable students included [[Aristoxenus]], [[Dicaearchus]], [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], [[Eudemos of Rhodes]], [[Harpalus]], [[Hephaestion]], [[Mnason of Phocis]], [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], and Theophrastus. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained &quot;Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?&quot;{{sfn| Plutarch | 1919 | p= Part 1, 7:7}}

===On Hellenistic science===
{{details | Ancient Greek medicine}}

After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.{{sfn| Annas | 2001 | page=252}} It is not until the age of [[Alexandria]] under the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found.

The first medical teacher at Alexandria, [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.{{sfn| Mason | 1979 | p= 56}} Though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Ernst Mayr]] states that there was &quot;nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.&quot;{{sfn| Mayr | 1985 | pp=90–94}}

===On Byzantine scholars===
{{see also | Commentaries on Aristotle | Byzantine Aristotelianism}}

Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were Philoponus, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and [[Stephen of Alexandria]] in the early seventh century.{{sfn| Sorabji | 1990 | pages=20, 28, 35–36}} [[John Philoponus]] stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought.{{sfn| Sorabji | 1990 | pages=233–74}} Philoponus questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics, noting its flaws and introducing the [[theory of impetus]] to explain his observations.{{sfn|Lindberg|1992|p=162}}

After a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and [[Michael of Ephesus]] reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by [[Anna Comnena]].{{sfn|Sorabji|1990|pp=20–21, 28–29, 393–406, 407–08}}

Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early [[Islamic theology]]. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle,{{sfn|Kennedy-Day|1998}} as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers, scientists and scholars. [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Alpharabius]], who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. [[Alkindus]] greatly admired Aristotle's philosophy,{{sfn|Staley|1989}} and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the &quot;exemplar&quot; for all future philosophers.{{sfn|Averroes|1953|p=III, 2, 43}} Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the &quot;First Teacher&quot;.{{sfn|Kennedy-Day|1998}} The title &quot;teacher&quot; was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]) who were influenced by the tradition of [[Islamic philosophy]].{{sfn|Nasr|1996|pp=59–60}}

With the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early [[medieval]] Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c. AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the ''Organon'' made by [[Boethius]]. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by [[Gerard of Cremona]],{{sfn| Hasse | 2014}} and from the original Greek, such as those by [[James of Venice]] and [[William of Moerbeke]]. After the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] Thomas Aquinas wrote his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', working from Moerbeke's translations and calling Aristotle &quot;The Philosopher&quot;,{{sfn|Aquinas|2013}} the demand for Aristotle's writings grew, and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn| Kuhn | 2018}} These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Boethius, [[Peter Abelard]], and [[John Buridan]] worked on Aristotelian logic.{{sfn| Lagerlund}}

A [[The tale of Phyllis and Aristotle|cautionary medieval tale]] held that Aristotle advised his pupil Alexander to avoid the king's seductive mistress, Phyllis, but was himself captivated by her, and allowed her to ride him. Phyllis had secretly told Alexander what to expect, and he witnessed Phyllis proving that a woman's charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher's male intellect. Artists such as [[Hans Baldung]] produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme.{{sfn| Aristotle Phyllis}}{{sfn|Phyllis and Aristotle}}

===On Early Modern scientists===
[[File:William Harvey ( 1578-1657) Venenbild.jpg | thumb | [[William Harvey]]'s ''[[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus|De Motu Cordis]]'', 1628, showed that the [[circulation of the blood|blood circulated]], contrary to classical era thinking.]]

In the [[Early Modern]] period, scientists such as [[William Harvey]] in England and [[Galileo Galilei]] in Italy reacted against the theories of Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like [[Galen]], establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment. Harvey demonstrated the [[circulation of the blood]], establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body's heat, as Aristotle thought.{{sfn| Aird | 2011 | pp=118–29}} Galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace Aristotle's physics, proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight.{{sfn| Machamer | 2017}}

===On 19th-century thinkers===

The 19th-century German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.{{sfn| Durant | 2006 | p=86}} Aristotle rigidly separated action from production, and argued for the deserved subservience of some people (&quot;natural slaves&quot;), and the natural superiority (virtue, ''arete'') of others. It was [[Martin Heidegger]], not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition.{{sfn| Sikka | 1997 | page=265}}

The English mathematician [[George Boole]] fully accepted Aristotle's logic, but decided &quot;to go under, over, and beyond&quot; it with his system of [[Boolean algebra|algebraic logic]] in his 1854 book ''[[The Laws of Thought]]''. This gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations, enables it to solve equations as well as check [[Validity (logic)|validity]], and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms, not just two.{{sfn| Boole | 2003}}

===Modern rejection and rehabilitation===
[[File:Alexander and Aristotle.jpg | thumb|upright=1.2 | left | &quot;That most enduring of romantic images, Aristotle tutoring the future conqueror Alexander&quot;.{{sfn|Kukkonen|2010|pages=70–77}} Illustration by {{interlanguage link|Charles Laplante|fr}}, 1866]]

During the 20th century, Aristotle's work was widely criticized. The philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]
argued that &quot;almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine&quot;. Russell called Aristotle's ethics &quot;repulsive&quot;, and labelled his logic &quot;as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy&quot;. Russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.{{sfn|Russell|1972}}

The Dutch historian of science [[Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis]] wrote that Aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by &quot;proceed[ing] so readily to frame a theory of such a general character&quot; on limited evidence from their senses.{{sfn|Dijksterhuis|1969|p=72}} In 1985, the biologist [[Peter Medawar]] could still state in &quot;pure seventeenth century&quot;{{sfn|Leroi|2015|p=353}} tones that Aristotle had assembled &quot;a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay, imperfect observation, wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility&quot;.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|p=353}}{{sfn|Medawar|Medawar|1984|p=28}}

By the start of the 21st century, however, Aristotle was taken more seriously: Kukkonen noted that &quot;In the best 20th-century scholarship Aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the Greek philosophical tradition.&quot;{{sfn|Kukkonen|2010|pp=70–77}} [[Ayn Rand]] accredited Aristotle as &quot;the greatest philosopher in history&quot; and cited him as a major influence on her thinking.{{sfn|Mayhew}} More recently, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.{{sfn|Knight|2007|pp=''passim''}} Kukkonen observed, too, that &quot;that most enduring of romantic images, Aristotle tutoring the future conqueror Alexander&quot; remained current, as in the 2004 film ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', while the &quot;firm rules&quot; of Aristotle's theory of drama have ensured a role for the ''Poetics'' in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]].{{sfn|Kukkonen|2010|pp=70–77}}

Biologists continue to be interested in Aristotle's thinking. [[Armand Marie Leroi]] has reconstructed Aristotle's biology,{{sfn|Leroi|2015}} while [[Tinbergen's four questions|Niko Tinbergen's four questions]], based on Aristotle's four causes, are used to analyse [[animal behaviour]]; they examine [[function (biology)|function]], [[phylogeny]], [[mechanism (biology)|mechanism]], and [[ontogeny]].{{sfn|MacDougall-Shackleton|2011|pp=2076–85}}{{sfn|Hladký|Havlíček|2013}}

==Surviving works==

===Corpus Aristotelicum===
{{main | Corpus Aristotelicum}}
[[File:Aristotelis De Moribus ad Nicomachum.jpg | thumb | upright | First page of a 1566 edition of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' in Greek and Latin]]

The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school. Reference to them is made according to the organization of [[Immanuel Bekker]]'s Royal Prussian Academy edition (''Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica'', Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.{{sfn| Aristotelis Opera}}

===Loss and preservation===
{{see | Recovery of Aristotle}}

Aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls, the common writing medium of that era.{{efn-ua | &quot;When the Roman dictator Sulla invaded Athens in 86 BC, he brought back to Rome a fantastic prize – Aristotle's library. Books then were papyrus rolls, from 10 to 20 feet long, and since Aristotle's death in 322 BC, worms and damp had done their worst. The rolls needed repairing, and the texts clarifying and copying on to new papyrus (imported from Egypt – Moses' bulrushes). The man in Rome who put Aristotle's library in order was a Greek scholar, Tyrannio.&quot;{{sfn| When libraries were | 2001}}}} His writings are divisible into two groups: the &quot;[[exoteric]]&quot;, intended for the public, and the &quot;[[esoteric]]&quot;, for use within the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] school.{{sfn| Barnes | 1995 | p=12}}{{efn-ua | 1=Aristotle: ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1102a26–27. Aristotle himself never uses the term &quot;esoteric&quot; or &quot;acroamatic&quot;. For other passages where Aristotle speaks of ''exōterikoi logoi'', see [[W.D. Ross]], ''Aristotle's Metaphysics'' (1953), vol. 2 pp= 408–10. Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle's own works, usually refers generally to &quot;discussions not peculiar to the [[Peripatetic school]]&quot;, rather than to specific works of Aristotle's own.}}{{sfn| House | 1956 | page=35}} Aristotle's &quot;lost&quot; works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication, the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication.{{sfn| Irwin | Fine | 1996 | pp= xi–xii }}{{sfn| Barnes | 1995 | p=12}} [[Cicero]]'s description of Aristotle's literary style as &quot;a river of gold&quot; must have applied to the published works, not the surviving notes.{{efn-ua | &quot;''veniet flumen orationis aureum fundens Aristoteles''&quot;, (Google translation: &quot;Aristotle will come pouring forth a golden stream of eloquence&quot;).{{sfn| Cicero | 1874}}}} A major question in the history of Aristotle's works is how the exoteric writings were all lost, and how the ones we now possess came to us.{{sfn| Barnes | Griffin | 1999 | pages=1–69}} The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.{{sfn| Anagnostopoulos | 2013 | page=16}}{{sfn| Barnes | 1995 | pp=10–15}}

==Legacy==

===Depictions===
;Paintings

Aristotle has been depicted by major artists including [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]],{{sfn| Lucas Cranach the Elder}} [[Justus van Gent]], [[Raphael]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]],{{sfn| Lee | Robinson | 2005}} [[Rembrandt]],{{sfn| Aristotle with Bust | 2002}} and [[Francesco Hayez]] over the centuries. Among the best-known is Raphael's [[fresco]] ''[[The School of Athens]]'', in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican's Apostolic Palace]], where the figures of Plato and Aristotle are central to the image, at the architectural [[vanishing point]], reflecting their importance.{{sfn| Phelan | 2002}} Rembrandt's ''[[Aristotle with a Bust of Homer]]'', too, is a celebrated work, showing the knowing philosopher and the blind Homer from an earlier age: as the art critic [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] writes, &quot;this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world, ensnaring us in its musty, glowing, pitch-black, terrible knowledge of time.&quot;{{sfn| Held | 1969}}{{sfn| Jones | 2002}}

'''''An American in Paris''''' is a jazz-influenced orchestral piece by American composer [[George Gershwin]] first performed in 1928. It was inspired by the time that Gershwin had spent in Paris and evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the 1920s.

[[Walter Damrosch]] had asked Gershwin to write a full concerto following the success of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' (1924).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/An-American-in-Paris-by-Gershwin &quot;''An American in Paris''&quot;], by Betsy Schwarm, ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus [[celesta]], saxophones, and automobile horns. He brought back four Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition, which took place on December 13, 1928, in [[Carnegie Hall]], with Damrosch conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf |title=Rhapsody in Blue for Piano and Orchestra : An American in Paris |author=George Gershwin |website=Nyphil.org |accessdate=April 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052949/http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/newsroom/1314/Releases/gilbert-ozone-final.pdf Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic: Makoto Ozone to Perform Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' in One-Night-Only Concert All-American Program Also to Include Bernstein's ''Candide'' Overture and Symphonic Dances from ''West Side Story'' Gershwin's ''An American in Paris'': April 22, 2014 at nyphil.org] Accessed June 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work's premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=2983 | title = ''An American in Paris'': About the Work | publisher = [[The Kennedy Center]] | author=Richard Freed|authorlink=Richard Freed| access-date=December 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]].

==Background==
Although the story is likely apocryphal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EkOfAAAAMAAJ |title=George Gershwin: His Life and Music |last=Schwartz|first=Charles|date=1973|isbn=9780672516627 }}{{page needed|date=December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gershwin is said to have been attracted by [[Maurice Ravel]]'s unusual chords, and Gershwin went on his first trip to Paris in 1926 ready to study with Ravel. After his initial student audition with Ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories, Ravel said he could not teach him, saying, &quot;Why be a second-rate Ravel when you can be a first-rate Gershwin?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/10/misunderstanding-gershwin/377252/ |title=Misunderstanding Gershwin |last=Schiff |first=David|authorlink=David Schiff|date=October 1, 1998 |magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=December 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That 1926 trip, however, resulted in a snippet of melody entitled &quot;Very Parisienne&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerswhin.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gershwin.com/publications/an-american-in-paris-concert-work/ |title=An American in Paris |website=Gershwin Enterprises |access-date=December 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the initial musical motive of ''An American in Paris'', written as a 'thank you note' to Gershwin's hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer. Gershwin called it &quot;a rhapsodic ballet&quot;; it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works.&lt;ref name=&quot;JablonskiStewart1958&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/gershwinyearsgeo00jabl|url-access=registration|title=The Gershwin Years: George And Ira|author1=Edward Jablonski|authorlink=Edward Jablonski|author2=Lawrence D.

Gershwin strongly encouraged Ravel to come to the United States for a tour. To this end, upon his return to New York, Gershwin joined the efforts of Ravel's friend [[E. Robert Schmitz|Robert Schmitz]], a pianist Ravel had met during the war, to urge Ravel to tour the U.S. Schmitz was the head of Pro Musica, promoting Franco-American musical relations, and was able to offer Ravel a $10,000 fee for the tour, an enticement Gershwin knew would be important to Ravel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goss&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bolerolifeofmaur1940goss |title=Bolero: the life of Maurice Ravel |last=Goss |first=Madeleine |publisher=New York, H.

Gershwin greeted Ravel in New York in March 1928 during a party held for Ravel's birthday by [[Éva Gauthier]].&lt;ref name=Burton&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://csosoundsandstories.org/fascinatin-rhythm-when-ravel-met-gershwin-in-jazz-age-new-york/ |title=Fascinatin' rhythm: When Ravel met Gershwin in Jazz Age New York |last=Burton |first=Louise |date=May 26, 2015 |website=CSO Sounds &amp; Stories |publisher=[[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] |access-date=December 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ravel's tour reignited Gershwin's desire to return to Paris, which he and his brother [[Ira Gershwin|Ira]] did after meeting Ravel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerswhin.com&quot; /&gt; Ravel's high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to [[Nadia Boulanger]] caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in Paris. Yet after he played for her, she told him she could not teach him. Boulanger gave Gershwin basically the same advice she gave all her accomplished master students: &quot;What could I give you that you haven't already got?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spycket1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_-VcUAeWQr0C&amp;pg=PA71|title=Nadia Boulanger|author=Jérôme Spycket|publisher=Pendragon Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-945193-38-8|pages=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack2007&quot; /&gt; This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]''. Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers, among them [[Ezra Pound]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Ernest Hemingway]]; and artist [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;LSRI Archives Oral Interview Anita Loos and Mary Anita Loos October 1979 re: letters and Ravel's telegram to Gershwin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Gershwin based ''An American in Paris'' on a melodic fragment called &quot;Very Parisienne&quot;, written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer.  He described the piece as a &quot;rhapsodic ballet&quot; because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works. Gershwin explained in ''[[Musical America]]'', &quot;My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RySwdc151ZoC&amp;pg=PA431|title=George Gershwin: His Life and Work|author=Howard Pollack|authorlink=Howard Pollack|date=January 15, 2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93314-9|location=|pages=119, 431–440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose [[Ternary form|ABA format]]. Gershwin's first A episode introduces the two main &quot;walking&quot; themes in the &quot;Allegretto grazioso&quot; and develops a third theme in the &quot;Subito con brio&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Van Dyke|first=Joseph M.|year=2011|title=George Gershwin's An American in Paris for Two Pianos: A Critical Score Study and Performance Guide|series=(Doctoral Thesis)|location=Columbus, OH|publisher=OhioLINK Electronic Theses and Dissertations Center|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:osu1298660291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Les Six]].&lt;ref name=Burton /&gt; This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns. The B section's &quot;Andante ma con ritmo deciso&quot; introduces the American [[Blues]] and spasms of homesickness. The &quot;Allegro&quot; that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster [[twelve-bar blues]]. In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. &quot;Moderato con grazia&quot; is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A. After recapitulating the &quot;walking&quot; themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final &quot;Grandioso&quot;.

==Response==
Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of ''An American in Paris''. He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with &quot;a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses.&quot; Critics believed that ''An American in Paris'' was better crafted than his [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]. Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[César Franck]], [[Richard Wagner]], or [[Guillaume Lekeu]] on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics, &quot;It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know... It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack2007&quot; /&gt;

==Instrumentation==
''An American in Paris'' was originally scored for 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|B-flat]], [[bass clarinet]] in B-flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]] in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in B-flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood block]], [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[Tom-tom drum|tom-toms]], [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 [[vehicle horn|taxi horns]] labeled as A, B, C and D with circles around them, [[alto saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone saxophone]], (all saxophones doubling soprano saxophones) and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/47d1f79a-8ea6-4aba-964f-989cb5dc2cd7/fullview#page/4/mode/2up|title=George Gershwin: An American in Paris (original score)|website=New York Philharmonic Archives|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904200637/http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/47d1f79a-8ea6-4aba-964f-989cb5dc2cd7/fullview#page/4/mode/2up|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=September 4, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes A, B, C and D, it has recently come to light&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/theater/have-we-been-playing-gershwin-wrong-for-70-years.html|title=Have We Been Playing Gershwin Wrong for 70 Years?|author=Michael Cooper|date=March 1, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Gershwin's intention was to have used the notes A{{Music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;[[Scientific pitch notation|4]]&lt;/sub&gt;, B{{Music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.music.umich.edu/ami/gershwin/?p=715 |title=1929 Gershwin Taxi Horn Photo Clarifies Mystery|publisher=[[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance]]|date=March 5, 2016|accessdate=April 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as A, B, C and D with circles, he was referring to the four horns and not the notes that they played.

A major revision of the work by composer and arranger F. Campbell-Watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments, alto, tenor and baritone. The soprano saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments and the contrabassoon was also deleted. This became the standard performing edition until 2000, when Gershwin specialist [[Jack Gibbons]] made his own restoration of the original orchestration of An American in Paris, working directly from Gershwin's original manuscript, including the restoration of Gershwin's soprano saxophone parts removed in F. Campbell-Watson's revision; Gibbons' restored orchestration of An American in Paris was performed at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall on July 9, 2000 by the City of Oxford Orchestra conducted by Levon Parikian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jackgibbons.com/reviews.htm|title=Musical Opinion review of Gershwin Spectacular|accessdate=June 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Merrigan Daly|William Daly]] arranged the score for piano solo; this was published by New World Music in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ljms.org/directory/ |title=CMS: ''An American in Paris'' Program Notes |last=Rodda |first=Richard E. |date=2013 |website=La Jolla Music Society|access-date=December 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.free-scores.com/download-sheet-music.php?pdf=82579 |title=Free sheet music : Gershwin, George – ''An American in Paris'' (Piano solo) |website=www.free-scores.com |access-date=December 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation status==
On September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological [[Historical editions (music)|critical edition]] of the full orchestral score would be eventually released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[University of Michigan]], were working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin's true intent. It was unknown if the critical score would include the four minutes of material Gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section), or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin's composition process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/new-critical-edition-of-george-and-ira-gershwins-works-to-be-compiled/ |title=New, critical edition of George and Ira Gershwin's works to be compiled &amp;#124; PBS NewsHour |website=Pbs.org |date=September 14, 2013 |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The score to ''An American in Paris'' was scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released. The entire project was expected take 30 to 40 years to complete, but ''An American in Paris'' was planned to be an early volume in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.music.umich.edu/ami/gershwin/?page_id=59 |title=The Editions » Gershwin |website=Music.umich.edu |date= September 8, 2013|accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://musicologynow.ams-net.org/2013/09/george-and-ira-gershwin-critical-edition_20.html |title=Musicology Now: George and Ira Gershwin Critical Edition |website=Musicologynow.ams-net.org |date=September 17, 2013 |accessdate=April 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215122523/http://musicologynow.ams-net.org/2013/09/george-and-ira-gershwin-critical-edition_20.html |archive-date=December 15, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[urtext edition]]s of the work were published by the German publisher B-Note Music in 2015. The changes made by Campbell-Watson were withdrawn in both editions. In the extended urtext, 120 bars of music were re-integrated. Conductor Walter Damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''An American in Paris'' Urtext | url=https://www.bnote.de/?set=werk_detail&amp;kompid=246&amp;bnnr=16963&amp;lc=en|website=Bnote.de |access-date=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2017, The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra gave the world premiere of the long-awaited critical edition of the piece prepared by Mark Clague, director of the Gershwin initiative at the University of Michigan.  This performance was of the original 1928 orchestration, except that it upheld the deletion of the contrabassoon part, an alteration usually attributed to F. Campbell-Watson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.eamdc.com/news/critical-edition-of-george-gershwins-an-american-in-paris-debuts-with-the-cincinnati-and-atlanta-symphony-orchestras/|title=Musical Opinion review of Gershwin Spectacular|accessdate=January 6, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
[[File:American in Paris.tif|thumb|First recording]]
''An American in Paris'' has been frequently recorded. The first recording was made for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Gershwin was on hand to &quot;supervise&quot; the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. This recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended using the notes A-flat, B-flat, a higher D and a lower A.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot; /&gt; The radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which ''An American in Paris,'' also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set. [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music. In 1945, [[Arturo Toscanini]] conducting the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] recorded the piece for [[RCA Victor]], one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer. The [[Seattle Symphony]] also recorded a version in 1990 of Gershwin's original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bargreen |first=Melinda |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900628&amp;slug=1079541 |title=Entertainment &amp; the Arts &amp;#124; Recordings &amp;#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |website=Community.seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=June 28, 1990 |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry James]] released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album ''One Night Stand,'' recorded live at the [[Aragon Ballroom (Chicago)|Aragon Ballroom in Chicago]] ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]] GL 522 and CL 522).

==Use in film==
In 1951, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] released the musical film ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Leslie Caron]]. Winning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards, the film was directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the ''An American in Paris'' symphonic poem (arranged for the film by [[Johnny Green]]), costing $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;The Eddie Mannix Ledger, Los Angeles: Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://daily.jstor.org/american-paris-onstage-onscreen/|title=''An American in Paris'': Onstage and Onscreen {{!}} JSTOR Daily|date=May 19, 2015|work=JSTOR Daily|access-date=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Academy Award for Best Production Design''' recognizes achievement for [[art direction]] in [[art director#In film|film]]. The category's original name was '''Best Art Direction''', but was changed to its current name in 2012 for the [[85th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Rules&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2012/20120830.html |title=Music Rules Approved for 85th Academy Awards |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004163009/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2012/20120830.html |archivedate=2014-10-04 |accessdate=2012-08-31 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change resulted from the Art Director's branch of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) being renamed the Designer's branch. Since [[19th Academy Awards|1947]], the award is shared with the set decorator(s). It is awarded to the best interior design in a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/best-art-direction-10.html |title=Academy Award for Best Art Direction |last= |first= |date= |website=Awardsandshows.com |access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The films below are listed with their production year (for example, the [[72nd Academy Awards|2000 Academy Award]] for Best Art Direction is given to a film from 1999). In the lists below, the winner of the award for each year is shown first, followed by the other nominees in alphabetical order.

The '''Academy Awards''', popularly known as '''the Oscars''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://thewrap.com/ampas-drops-85th-academy-awards-now-its-just-oscars-78211/ |title=AMPAS Drops '85th Academy Awards' – Now It's Just 'The Oscars' |date=February 19, 2013 |work=[[TheWrap]] |access-date=April 9, 2017 |url-status=live  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803081821/http://www.thewrap.com/ampas-drops-85th-academy-awards-now-its-just-oscars-78211/ |archivedate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are awards for artistic and technical merit in the [[film industry]]. Given annually by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS), the awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements, as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. The various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette, officially called the &quot;Academy Award of Merit&quot;, although more commonly referred to by its nickname, the &quot;Oscar&quot;. The statuette depicts a knight rendered in the [[Art Deco]] style.

The award was originally sculpted by [[George Stanley (sculptor)|George Stanley]] from a design sketch by [[Cedric Gibbons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nichols |first1=Chris |title=Meet George Stanley, Sculptor of the Academy Award |url=http://www.lamag.com/askchris/meet-george-stanley-sculptor-of-the-academy-award/ |accessdate=November 6, 2017 |publisher=Los Angeles Magazine |date=February 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014733/http://www.lamag.com/askchris/meet-george-stanley-sculptor-of-the-academy-award/ |archive-date=November 7, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; AMPAS first [[1st Academy Awards|presented it in 1929]] at a private dinner hosted by [[Douglas Fairbanks]] in the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] in what would become known as the [[1st Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html |title=About the Academy Awards |publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 13, 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070407234926/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html |archivedate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,273341,00.html |title=The Birth of Oscar |first=Andrew |last=Essex |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=May 14, 1999 |accessdate=March 2, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111215005/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C273341%2C00.html |archivedate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy Awards ceremony was first broadcast by radio in 1930 and was televised for the first time in 1953. It is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now televised live worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; It is also the oldest of the [[EGOT|four major annual American entertainment awards]]; its equivalents – the [[Emmy Award]]s for television, the [[Tony Award]]s for theater, and the [[Grammy Award]]s for music – are modeled after the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paleycenter.org/p-the-mightiest-of-all-award-shows-the-academy-awards-2/|title=The Lure of Oscar: A Look at the Mightiest of All Award Shows, the Academy Awards|last=Monush|first=Barry|website=The Paley Center for Media|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.paleycenter.org/p-the-mightiest-of-all-award-shows-the-academy-awards-2/|archivedate=October 29, 2019|accessdate=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are widely cited as the most famous and prestigious competitive awards in the field of entertainment.

The [[92nd Academy Awards]] ceremony, honoring the [[2019 in film|best films of 2019]], was held on February 9, 2020. As with [[91st Academy Awards|the previous ceremony]], there was no host. The ceremony was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It took place at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California, for the 18th consecutive year. This ceremony marked the first time in Oscar history that more than three films had received ten or more nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/things-to-do/historic-academy-awards-venues|title=Historic Academy Awards Venues|website=Discover Los Angeles|access-date=November 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 3,140 Oscar statuettes have been awarded since its inception in 1929.&lt;ref name=&quot;statuette&quot; /&gt;

==History==
The [[1st Academy Awards|first Academy Awards]] presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner function at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] with an audience of about 270 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1929|title=The 1st Academy Awards {{!}} 1929|website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|access-date=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html |title=History of the Academy Awards |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706040444/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html |archivedate=July 6, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 (${{Inflation|US|5|1929}} in 2020 dollars). Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15&amp;nbsp;minutes.

Winners were announced to media three months earlier. That was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; This method was used until 1940, when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;

===Milestones===
The first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in ''[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]'' and ''[[The Way of All Flesh (1927 film)|The Way of All Flesh]]''. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;

At the 29th ceremony, held in 1957, the Best Foreign Language Film category, now known as [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]], was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.

Perhaps the most widely seen [[streaking|streaker]] in history was 34-year-old Robert Opel, who streaked across the stage of The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles flashing a peace sign on national US television at the 46th Academy Awards in 1974. Bemused host David Niven quipped, &quot;Isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?&quot; Later, evidence arose suggesting that Opel's appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show's producer Jack Haley Jr. Robert Metzler, the show's business manager, believed that the incident had been planned in some way; during the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler's wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line, which was thus not the ad-lib it appeared to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What You Won't See at Oscars On Cue: Behind Those Cameras on Oscar Night |author=Steve Harvey |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 29, 1993 |page=F1|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-29-ca-16650-story.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2014/02/28/disney-hoping-to-win-first-oscar-for-best-animated-feature/ |title=Disney hoping to win first Oscar for Best Animated Feature |date=February 28, 2014 |work=New York Post |access-date=April 18, 2018  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419053447/https://nypost.com/2014/02/28/disney-hoping-to-win-first-oscar-for-best-animated-feature/ |archive-date=April 19, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1973, all Academy Awards ceremonies have ended with the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].

Traditionally, the previous year's winner for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, while the previous year's winner for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.

The best known award is the Academy Award of Merit, more popularly known as the Oscar statuette.&lt;ref name=&quot;statuette&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Oscar Statuette |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/statuette |accessdate=February 27, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301182257/https://www.oscars.org/oscars/statuette |archivedate=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made of gold-plated [[bronze]] on a black metal base, it is 13.5&amp;nbsp;in (34.3&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&amp;nbsp;lb (3.856&amp;nbsp;kg), and depicts a knight rendered in [[Art Deco]] style holding a [[crusades|crusader's]] sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes.

Sculptor [[George Stanley (sculptor)|George Stanley]] (who also did the Muse Fountain at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]) sculpted [[Cedric Gibbons]]' design. The statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze. Within a few years, the bronze was abandoned in favor of [[Britannia metal]], a pewter-like alloy which is then plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally, 24-karat gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;statuette&quot; /&gt; Due to a metal shortage during World War II, Oscars were made of painted plaster for three years. Following the war, the Academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.com/legacy/?pn=statuette&amp;page=2 |title=Oscar Statuette: Manufacturing, Shipping and Repairs |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927134712/http://www.oscars.com/legacy/?pn=statuette&amp;page=2 |archivedate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base.

===Naming===
The Academy officially adopted the name &quot;Oscar&quot; for the trophies in 1939. However, the origin of the nickname is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hiskey |first1=Daven |title=Why Are the Academy Awards Statuettes Called Oscars? |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/48892/why-are-academy-awards-statuettes-called-oscars |website=Mental Floss |accessdate=February 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225051435/http://mentalfloss.com/article/48892/why-are-academy-awards-statuettes-called-oscars |archive-date=February 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One biography of [[Bette Davis]], who was a president of the Academy in 1941, claims she named the award after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson. A frequently mentioned originator is [[Margaret Herrick]], the Academy executive secretary, who, when she first saw the award in 1931, said the statuette reminded her of &quot;Uncle Oscar&quot;, a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-who-came-up-name-774775|title=Oscars: Who Came Up With the Name &quot;Oscar&quot; and More About the Statuette's History (Video)|website=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- 1934 and the media --&gt;
Columnist Sidney Skolsky, who was present during Herrick's naming in 1931, wrote that &quot;Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar.'&quot;&lt;ref name = levy&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first= Emanuel |title=All About Oscar: The History and Politics of the Academy Awards |year=2003 |publisher=Burns &amp; Oates |isbn=978-0-8264-1452-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy credits Skolsky with &quot;the first confirmed newspaper reference&quot; to ''Oscar'' in his column on March 16, 1934, which was written about that year's [[6th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 6th Academy Awards Memorable Moments |url= https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1934/memorable-moments |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=February 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226111216/https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1934/memorable-moments |archive-date=February 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1934 awards appeared again in another early media mention of ''Oscar'': a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747239,00.html |work=Time |title=Cinema: Oscars |date=March 26, 1934 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813182253/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C747239%2C00.html |archivedate=August 13, 2013}}(subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; In the ceremonies that year, [[Walt Disney]] was the first to thank the Academy for his &quot;Oscar&quot; during his acceptance speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://d23.com/oscar-winning-walt/ |title=Oscar-Winning Walt |publisher=d23.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705190129/https://d23.com/oscar-winning-walt/ |archivedate=July 5, 2019|url-status = live |first = Jim|last = Fanning|date = March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engraving===
To prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates. Until 2010, winners returned their statuettes to the Academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective Oscars. Since 2010, winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor's Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. The R.S. Owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony, bearing the name of every potential winner. The nameplates for the non-winning nominees are later recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Oscar statues to include engraved names |first=Greg |last=Kilday |date=February 9, 2010 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-statues-include-engraved-names-20476 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412143119/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-statues-include-engraved-names-20476 |archivedate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Governors Ball Secrets: Welcome to the 'Engraving Station,' Where Oscar Statuettes Get Personalized |url=http://parade.com/266251/stevedaly/governors-ball-secrets-welcome-to-the-engraving-station-where-oscar-statuettes-get-personalized/ |first=Steve |last=Daly |date=February 28, 2014 |work=Parade Magazine |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227170517/http://parade.com/266251/stevedaly/governors-ball-secrets-welcome-to-the-engraving-station-where-oscar-statuettes-get-personalized/ |archivedate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ownership of Oscar statuettes===
Prior to 1950 Oscar statuettes were (and remain) the property of the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/02/28/cx_lr_0228oscarsales.html |title=Psst!

If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.&lt;ref name=&quot;money.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.com/money/5181378/how-much-oscar-statue-worth/|title=How Much Is an Oscar Statue Worth?

In 1989 [[Mike Todd|Michael Todd's]] grandson tried to sell Todd's [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] Oscar for his 1956 production of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' to a movie prop collector.  The Academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale.

In 1992, [[Harold Russell]] consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' to auction in order to raise money for his wife's medical expenses.  Though his decision caused controversy, the first-ever Oscar to be sold passed   to a private collector on August 6, 1992 for $60,500 (${{Inflation|US|60500|1992|r=-2|fmt=c}} today). Russell defended his action, saying, &quot;I don't know why anybody would be critical. My wife's health is much more important than sentimental reasons. The movie will be here, even if Oscar isn't.&quot; .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/movies/redcarpet/id-really-like-to-thank-my-pal-at-the-auction-house.html |title=I'd Really Like to Thank My Pal at the Auction House |last=Rothman |first=Heathcliff |date=February 12, 2006 |work=The New York Times |access-date=September 20, 2017  |issn=0362-4331 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921095530/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/movies/redcarpet/id-really-like-to-thank-my-pal-at-the-auction-house.html |archive-date=September 21, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, [[Orson Welles]]' 1941 Oscar for ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' ([[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/12/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html |title=Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' Oscar for sale |publisher=CNN |first=Alan |last=Duke |date=December 12, 2011 |accessdate=December 12, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112025602/http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/12/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html |archivedate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2011, it sold in an online auction for US$861,542 (${{Inflation|US|0.861542|2011|r=2|fmt=c}} million today).&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles' Oscar sold&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' Oscar brings $861,000 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/21/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html |accessdate=April 7, 2013 |publisher=CNN |date=December 21, 2011 |first=Alan |last=Duke |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116121806/http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/21/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html |archivedate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomination==
Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in mid-January. Prior to that, the results were announced in early February.

===Voters===
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of over 7,000 {{as of|lc=y|2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.refinery29.com/2018/02/190829/academy-members-women-oscar-voters |title=How Many Women Are Actually Voting for the Oscar Winners? |access-date=April 18, 2018  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417232906/https://www.refinery29.com/2018/02/190829/academy-members-women-oscar-voters |archive-date=April 17, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (and its predecessor [[Price Waterhouse]]) since the [[7th Academy Awards]] in 1935. The firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the Academy in December to reflect the previous eligible year with a due date sometime in January of the next year, then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://mentalfloss.com/article/54560/how-are-oscar-nominees-chosen |title=How Are Oscar Nominees Chosen? |date=January 24, 2017  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180722072631/http://mentalfloss.com/article/54560/how-are-oscar-nominees-chosen |archive-date=July 22, 2018 |url-status=live |first = Sean|last = Hutchinson|work = Mental Floss}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm |title=The men who are counting on Oscar |work=BBC News |first=Jackie |last=Finlay |date=March 3, 2006 |accessdate= April 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319204536/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-the-two-people-who-already-know-the-oscar-winners-2017-02-24?mod=mw_share_twitter Meet the only two people in the world who already know all the Oscar winners {{!}} Market Watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150240/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-the-two-people-who-already-know-the-oscar-winners-2017-02-24?mod=mw_share_twitter |date=February 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures.

New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members.

In 2012, the results of a study conducted by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS' voting membership. Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were Caucasian, 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60. 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Horn |first=John |title=Unmasking the Academy |url=https://latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html,0,7473284.htmlstory |accessdate=October 15, 2013 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=February 19, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307133844/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html%2C0%2C7473284.htmlstory |archivedate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting would be implemented in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/electronic-voting-comes-to-the-oscars-finally |work=The New York Times |first=Michael |last=Cieply |title=Electronic Voting Comes to The Oscars (Finally) |date=May 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105075132/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/electronic-voting-comes-to-the-oscars-finally/ |archivedate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules===
According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], California, and play for seven consecutive days, to qualify (except for the Best International Feature Film, Best Documentary Feature, and awards in short film categories). Additionally, the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run, with at least one of the daily showings starting between 6&amp;nbsp;pm and 10&amp;nbsp;pm local time.&lt;ref name=92Rule2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |title=Rule Two: Eligibility |work=92nd Academy Awards of Merit: Rules |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://submissions.oscars.org/FAQ.aspx |title=Oscars Submission FAQ |accessdate=March 16, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401230002/https://submissions.oscars.org/FAQ.aspx |archivedate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Best International Feature Film award does not require a U.S. release. It requires the film to be submitted as its country's official selection.

The Best Documentary Feature award requires either week-long releases in both Los Angeles County and New York City{{efn|Starting with the [[89th Academy Awards|2017 awards]], a qualifying release for the Documentary Feature award can take place anywhere in New York City. Previously, a New York City qualifying run could only take place in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.oscars.org/news/awards-rules-approved-89th-oscarsr |title=Awards Rules Approved for 89th Oscars® |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |date=June 30, 2016 |accessdate=April 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  during the previous calendar year, or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the Documentary Feature Qualifying Festival list (regardless of any public exhibition or distribution), or a submission in the International Feature Film category as its country's official selection. The qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non-documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings. Additionally, a film must have been reviewed by a critic from ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time Out New York]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', or ''[[LA Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name=92Rule11&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |title=Rule Eleven: Special Rules for the Documentary Awards |work=92nd Academy Awards of Merit: Rules |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awards in short film categories (Best Documentary Short Subject, Best Animated Short Film, and Best Live Action Short Film) have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards. First, the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year, instead covering a one-year period starting on October 1 and ending on September 30 of the calendar year before the ceremony. Second, there are multiple methods of qualification. The main method is a week-long theatrical release in ''either'' Los Angeles County ''or'' New York City during the eligibility period. Films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of a number of competitive film festivals designated by the Academy, also without regard to prior public distribution. Finally, a film that is selected as a gold, silver, or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous Student Academy Awards is also eligible (Documentary category for that award, and Animation, Narrative, Alternative, or International for the other awards). The requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards. Only one screening per day is required. For the Documentary award, the screening must start between noon and 10&amp;nbsp;pm local time; for other awards, no specific start time is required, but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times.&lt;ref name=92Rule11/&gt;&lt;ref name=92Rule19&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/92aa_rules.pdf |title=Rule Nineteen: Special Rules for the Short Film Awards |work=92nd Academy Awards of Merit: Rules |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] winner, ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', was actually first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the [[81st Academy Awards|2008 awards]], as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the [[82nd Academy Awards|2009 awards]]. Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can submit only one film for consideration in the International Feature Film category per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youbioit.com/en/article/shared-information/949/academy-and-its-oscar-awards |title=The Academy and its Oscar Awards – Reminder List of Eligible Releases |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111232741/http://www.youbioit.com/en/article/shared-information/949/academy-and-its-oscar-awards |archivedate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40&amp;nbsp;minutes, except for short-subject awards, and it must exist either on a [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] or [[70 mm film]] print or in 24&amp;nbsp;frame/s or 48&amp;nbsp;frame/s [[progressive scan]] [[digital cinema]] format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/sites/default/files/87aa_rules.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021054540/http://www.oscars.org/sites/default/files/87aa_rules.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2014 |title=Academy Award Rules |accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[90th Academy Awards]], presented in 2018, multi-part and limited series have been ineligible for the Best Documentary Feature award. This followed the win of ''[[O.J.: Made in America]]'', an eight-hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[ESPN]], in that category in [[89th Academy Awards|2017]]. The Academy's announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/oscars-new-rules-documentary-oj-made-in-america-barred-1202026406/ |title=Oscars: New Rules Bar Multi-Part Documentaries Like 'O.J.: Made in America' |first=Dave |last=McNary |magazine=Variety |date=April 7, 2017 |accessdate=May 30, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415012418/http://variety.com/2017/film/news/oscars-new-rules-documentary-oj-made-in-america-barred-1202026406/ |archivedate=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.

In late December, ballots, and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6,000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc.). In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees. In all major categories, a variant of the [[single transferable vote]] is used, with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees (ten for Best Picture) ranked preferentially.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheEnvelope&quot;&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017160343/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/oscars/env-oscarvote7jan07%2C0%2C6919642%2Cprint.story?coll=env-home-headlines |archivedate=October 17, 2006 |url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/oscars/env-oscarvote7jan07,0,6919642,print.story?coll=env-home-headlines |title=Eight things every voter (and fan) should know about Oscar's decidedly unique nomination process. |first=Steve |last=Pond |accessdate=January 27, 2007 |date=January 7, 2006 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2011/01/27/oscar-voter-ballot-reader-poll-results |title=Oscars: The wacky way the Academy counts votes, and the results of our 'If You Were an Oscar Voter' poll |last=Young |first=John |date=January 27, 2011 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=February 29, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506042043/http://www.ew.com/article/2011/01/27/oscar-voter-ballot-reader-poll-results |archivedate=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vox&quot; /&gt; In certain categories, including International Feature Film, Documentary and Animated Feature, nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches.

Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|marketing to awards voters]] for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in [[Oscar season]]. The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marketing to Moviegoers: A Handbook of Strategies and Tactics |first=Robert |last=Marich |publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]] |edition=3rd |year=2013 |pages=235–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a producer of the 2009 Best Picture nominee ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner (''The Hurt Locker'' eventually won).

The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)

The Academy Awards is the world's longest-running awards show televised live from the U.S. to all time zones in North America and worldwide, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/oscars-what-were-the-longest-ceremony-telecasts-in-academy-awards-history-1.11488884|title=What was the longest Oscars telecast ever?|website=Newsday|access-date=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oscars were first televised in [[25th Academy Awards|1953]] by [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until [[32nd Academy Awards|1960]], when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in [[38th Academy Awards|1966]]) through [[42nd Academy Awards|1970]]. NBC regained the rights for five years {{nowrap|(1971–75),}} then ABC resumed broadcast duties in [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |title=ABC Signs Expansive New Agreement to Broadcast The Oscars, Hollywood's Biggest Entertainment Ceremony, Through 2028 |publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |date=August 31, 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202130914/https://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony |archivedate=February 2, 2017|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets (especially those outside of the Americas) in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by [[56th Academy Awards|1984]], the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.

The ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February, since [[76th Academy Awards|2004]], to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Basketball Tournament]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. (In [[48th Academy Awards|1976]] and [[49th Academy Awards|1977]], ABC's regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite NBC's NCAA title game.) The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March to avoid a clash with the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and Easter, which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscars-academy-awards-date-changes_n_5cffe0dee4b02c23d2d2860e|title=The Oscars Are Experimenting with a Series Of Date Changes|last=Fang|first=Marina|date=June 11, 2019|website=HuffPost|access-date=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The production of the Academy Awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most [[Emmy Awards|Emmys]] in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations overall since that award's own launch in [[21st Academy Awards|1949]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html |title=Emmys love for Oscars continues with 12 nominations |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Tom |last=O'Neil |date=July 12, 2010 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819172053/http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html |archivedate=August 19, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail).

Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect, with the segment having a &quot;[[popularity contest]]&quot; feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject's cultural impact; the applause has since been muted during the telecast, and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead. This segment was later followed by a commercial break.

In terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15&amp;nbsp;minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty-three minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Ehbar, Ned (February 28, 2014). &quot;Did you know?&quot; ''Metro''.

Although still dominant in ratings, the viewership of the Academy Awards has steadily dropped; the [[88th Academy Awards]] were the lowest-rated in the past eight years (although with increases in male and 18–49 viewership), while the show itself also faced mixed reception. Following the show, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that ABC was, in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the Oscars, seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself. Currently and nominally, AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast, including the choice of production staff and hosting, although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety-struggleabc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=ABC's Oscar Contract Renegotiations: Who'll Get Creative Control? |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-academy-oscars-deal-renegotiations-oscars-2016-1201718452/ |website=Variety |accessdate=March 2, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302000335/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-academy-oscars-deal-renegotiations-oscars-2016-1201718452/ |archivedate=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, AMPAS extended its contract with ABC through 2028: the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety-2028&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Inside the Oscars Deal: What it Means for ABC and the Academy |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-oscars-deal-status-quo-1201849487/ |website=Variety |accessdate=September 2, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901184910/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/abc-oscars-deal-status-quo-1201849487/ |archivedate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV ratings===
Historically, the telecast's viewership is higher when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture award. More than 57.25&amp;nbsp;million viewers tuned to the telecast for the [[70th Academy Awards]] in 1998, the year of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', which generated a box office haul during its initial 1997–98 run of US$600.8&amp;nbsp;million in the US, a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html |work=The Seattle Times |title=Academy's red carpet big stage for advertisers |first=Meg |last=James |date=February 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115833/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html |archivedate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[76th Academy Awards]] ceremony, in which ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368&amp;nbsp;million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture, drew 43.56&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday_oscar&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2005-01-26-oscar-telecast_x.htm |work=USA Today |title=Oscars lack blockbuster to lure TV viewers |date=January 26, 2005 |first=Scott |last=Bowles |accessdate=November 8, 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915033557/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2005-01-26-oscar-telecast_x.htm |archivedate=September 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most watched ceremony based on [[Nielsen ratings]] to date, however, was the [[42nd Academy Awards]] (Best Picture ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'') which drew a 43.4% household rating on April 7, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Justin |last=Oppelaar |url=https://variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime |title=Charts and Data: Top 100 TV Shows of All Time by '&amp;#39;Variety'&amp;#39; |magazine=Variety.com |date=October 9, 2002 |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118083655/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime |archivedate=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings, despite how much critically acclaimed those films have been. The [[78th Academy Awards]] which awarded low-budget independent film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4&amp;nbsp;million) generated an audience of 38.64&amp;nbsp;million with a household rating of 22.91%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-03-07-nielsen-analysis_x.htm |title=Low Ratings ''Crash'' Party |work=USA Today |first=Gary |last=Levin |date=March 7, 2006 |accessdate=April 14, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611173534/http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-03-07-nielsen-analysis_x.htm |archivedate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[80th Academy Awards]] telecast was watched by 31.76&amp;nbsp;million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest-rated and least-watched ceremony at the time, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080227/LIFE/802270307 |title=Oscar ratings worst ever |work=The Washington Post |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330005242/http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080227%2FLIFE%2F802270307 |archivedate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film (''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'').

The 92nd Academy Awards drew an average of 23.6&amp;nbsp;million viewers -- a new low.

==Venues==
In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]]. From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] and the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] in downtown Los Angeles.

[[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The [[21st Academy Awards]] in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what had been the Academy's headquarters on [[Melrose Avenue]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/venues.html |title=Oscars Award Venues |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212063803/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/venues.html |archivedate=December 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]]. With the advent of television, the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York, first at the [[Majestic Theatre (Columbus Circle)|NBC International Theatre]] (1953) and then at the [[New Century Theatre|NBC Century Theatre]], after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles. The Oscars moved to the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], California, in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Downtown Los Angeles, this time to the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] at the [[Los Angeles Music Center|Los Angeles County Music Center]]. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the ceremony returned to the Shrine.

In 2002, Hollywood's [[Dolby Theatre]] (previously known as the Kodak Theatre) became the presentation's current venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oscars' home renamed Dolby Theatre |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57425417/oscars-home-renamed-dolby-theatre/ |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502081049/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57425417/oscars-home-renamed-dolby-theatre/ |archivedate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first year of the awards, the Best Directing award was split into two categories (Drama and Comedy). At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical). From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two categories (black-and-white films and color films). Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.

In August 2018, the Academy announced that several categories would not be televised live, but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-plans-three-hour-oscars-telecast-adds-popular-film-category-1133138 |title=Oscars Won't Televise All Awards, Adds Popular Film Category |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=August 8, 2018  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103125108/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-plans-three-hour-oscars-telecast-adds-popular-film-category-1133138 |archive-date=November 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following dissent from Academy members, they announced that they would indeed air all 24 categories live. This followed a number of proposals (among them, the introduction of a Popular Film category) that the Academy had announced but did not implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://time.com/5531252/air-all-awards-oscars-2019/ |title=Academy Reverses Decision, Will Air All Awards at the 2019 Oscars |work=Time |access-date=February 16, 2019  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217185917/http://time.com/5531252/air-all-awards-oscars-2019/ |archive-date=February 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Undue weight section|date=April 2016}}

===Accusations of commercialism===
Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the &quot;[[Oscar season]]&quot;. This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than by quality. [[William Friedkin]], an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as &quot;the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Friedkin, William (Director) |date=February 24, 2009 |title=Director William Friedkin at the Hudson Union Society |url=http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |accessdate=March 11, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310081013/http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |archivedate=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Dirks, editor of [[American Movie Classics|AMC's]] [[filmsite.org]], has written of the Academy Awards:

{{quote|Unfortunately, the critical worth, artistic vision, cultural influence and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight. Especially since the 1980s, moneymaking &quot;formula-made&quot; blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd-pleasing titans (and Best Picture winners), but they haven't necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html |title=Academy Awards – The Oscars |accessdate=4 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120093333/http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html |archivedate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}A recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the Oscar season is the [[whisper campaign]]. These campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie. Examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'' suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]'' distorts history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscars-dirty-tricks-inside-whisper-405693 |title=Oscar's Dirty Tricks: Inside the Whisper Campaign Machine (Analysis) |last=Kilday |first=Gregg |date=December 20, 2012 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043347/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscars-dirty-tricks-inside-whisper-405693 |archive-date=March 6, 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=March 2, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of bias===
{{further|Oscar bait}}
Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies and family melodramas, most of which are released in the U.S. the last three months of the calendar year. The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. This has led to the coining of the term '[[Oscar bait]]', describing such movies. This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g., by favoring 'Oscar bait' over audience favorites, or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |title=Have the Oscars jumped the shark? |accessdate=January 24, 2012 |work=New York Post |first=Kyle |last=Smith |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418115808/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |archivedate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of a lack of diversity===
The Academy Awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hollywood-diversity-disabled-20160610-snap-story.html |title=In Hollywood, diversity tends to ignore the disabled |accessdate=April 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426062804/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hollywood-diversity-disabled-20160610-snap-story.html |archivedate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/24/oscars-diversity-debate-must-include-learning-disability|title = Oscars diversity debate must include learning disability|work = The Guardian|date = February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/oscars-2016-lack-diversity-historically-problem/story?id=37062502 |title=Oscars 2016: Lack of Diversity Has Historically Been a Problem |accessdate=April 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426150745/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/oscars-2016-lack-diversity-historically-problem/story?id=37062502 |archivedate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism is based on the statistics from every Academy Awards since 1929, which shows us that only 6.4% of academy award nominees have been non-white and since 1991, 11.2% of nominees have been non-white, with the rate of winners being even more polarizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://labs.time.com/story/oscars-diversity/ |title=This Chart Proves the Oscars Have a Serious Diversity Problem |last=Berman |first=Eliza |website=Time  |access-date=April 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430194958/http://labs.time.com/story/oscars-diversity/ |archive-date=April 30, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; More white actresses have won Oscars for [[Examples of yellowface|yellowface]] portrayals of Asian characters than actual Asian actresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.history.com/news/yellowface-whitewashing-in-film-america |title=Casting White People in Asian Roles Goes Back Centuries  |access-date=May 22, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190119135943/https://www.history.com/news/yellowface-whitewashing-in-film-america |archive-date=January 19, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.huffpost.com/entry/11-times-the-oscars-honored-white-actors-for-playing-people-of-color_n_58aefe72e4b0140601306fe8 |title = 11 Times The Oscars Honored White Actors For Playing People Of Color|work = HuffPost |first = Carolina |last = Moreno|date = 24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[88th Academy Awards|88th awards ceremony]] became the target of a boycott, popularized on social media with the [[hashtag]] #OscarsSoWhite, based on critics' perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias.

===Symbolism or sentimentalization===
Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://incontention.com/?p=1045 |title=What's the worst Best Actor choice of all time? |accessdate= October 4, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115115957/http://incontention.com/?p=1045 |archivedate=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make up for a &quot;snub&quot; for a performance/work that proved in time to be more popular and/or renowned than the one actually awarded, or presented as a &quot;career honor&quot; to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work.&lt;ref name=&quot;levy&quot; /&gt;

===Recognition of streaming media film===
Following the [[91st Academy Awards]] in February 2019 in which the [[Netflix]]-broadcast film ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]]'' had been nominated for ten awards including the Best Picture category, Steven Spielberg and other members of the Academy discussed changing the requirements through the Board of Governors for films as to exclude those from Netflix and other media streaming services. Spielberg had been concerned that Netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical Oscar-winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other Best Picture-nominated films, while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical-run status to qualify for an Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/steven-spielberg-vs-netflix-oscar-academy-wars-1202047846/ |title=The Spielberg vs. Netflix Battle Could Mean Collateral Damage for Indies at the Oscars |first=Anna |last=Thompson |date=February 28, 2019 |accessdate=April 24, 2019 |work=[[IndieWire]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190320081430/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/steven-spielberg-vs-netflix-oscar-academy-wars-1202047846/ | archive-date = March 20, 2019 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice]], having heard of this potential rule change, wrote a letter to the Academy in March 2019, cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti-trust concerns against the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/politics/news/doj-oscar-rules-changes-netflix-1203178413/ |title=Justice Department Warns Academy Over Potential Oscar Rule Changes Threatening Netflix |first=Ted |last=Johnson |date=April 2, 2019 |accessdate=April 24, 2019 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190423210652/https://variety.com/2019/politics/news/doj-oscar-rules-changes-netflix-1203178413/ | archive-date = April 23, 2019 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its April 2019 board meeting, the Academy Board of Governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for Oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/entertainment/academy-streaming-oscars/index.html |title=Academy doesn't change streaming eligibility for Oscars |first=Lisa |last=Respers France |date=April 24, 2019 |accessdate=April 24, 2019 |publisher=[[CNN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190424125530/https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/entertainment/academy-streaming-oscars/index.html | archive-date = April 24, 2019 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refusals of the award===
Some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was screenwriter [[Dudley Nichols]] (Best Writing in 1935 for ''[[The Informer (1935 film)|The Informer]]''). Nichols boycotted the [[8th Academy Awards]] ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild.&lt;ref name=&quot;DYK&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |title=The Oscars Did You Know? |accessdate=June 18, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000022/http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |archivedate=June 23, 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three years later, at the 1938 ceremony. Nichols was nominated for three further Academy Awards during his career.

[[George C. Scott]] became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'') at the [[43rd Academy Awards]] ceremony. Scott described it as a &quot;meat parade&quot;, saying, &quot;I don't want any part of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm |work=BBC News |title=George C Scott: The man who refused an Oscar |date=September 23, 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311095900/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm |archivedate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904789,00.html |work=Time |title=Show Business: Meat Parade |date=March 8, 1971 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221203341/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C904789%2C00.html |archivedate=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |title=Fast Facts – Did You Know? |publisher=Biography.com |date=May 16, 1929 |accessdate=February 6, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210075430/http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |archivedate=February 10, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third person to refuse the award was [[Marlon Brando]], who refused his award (Best Actor for 1972's ''[[The Godfather]]''), citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. At the [[45th Academy Awards]] ceremony, Brando sent actress and [[civil rights activist]] [[Sacheen Littlefeather]] to read a 15-page speech, detailing his criticisms, which was [[Booing|booed]] by the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Oscars |title=Marlon Brando's Oscar win for &quot; The Godfather&quot; |date=October 2, 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QUacU0I4yU |access-date=February 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217152537/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QUacU0I4yU |archive-date=February 17, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DYK&quot; /&gt;

===Incidents===
At the [[89th Academy Awards]] ceremony, [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] mistakenly announced ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' as the recipient of the Best Picture award, instead of ''[[Moonlight (2016 film)|Moonlight]]'', the actual winner. Beatty had been given the wrong envelope and after hesitating during the announcement, handed the envelope to Dunaway, which listed [[Emma Stone]] as Best Actress for ''La La Land'' and led to the confusion. The proper winner was announced after the acceptance speeches by ''La La Land'' producers [[Fred Berger (producer)|Fred Berger]], [[Jordan Horowitz]] and [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]].

The [[90th Academy Awards|following year]], Beatty and Dunaway were invited back as presenters of the Best Picture award, which they accomplished without error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Warren Beatty recalls 'chaos' of Oscars night |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/14/warren-beatty-recalls-chaos-of-oscars-night |first=Maev |last=Kennedy |accessdate=August 1, 2018 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801190400/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/14/warren-beatty-recalls-chaos-of-oscars-night |archivedate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plagiarism controversies===
* ''[[Zootopia]]'': On March 21, 2017, a copyright infringement lawsuit was filed against Disney by Esplanade Productions, a company owned by [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary L. Goldman]], co-screenwriter of ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]''. The lawsuit claims that Goldman (in 2000 and 2009) pitched a concept to Disney for a live-action film titled ''Looney'', which was about a socially awkward animator who creates a self-inspired TV cartoon called ''Zootopia''. Disney twice rejected the pitch, but Goldman accused the company of copying the name, themes, settings and character tropes. Filed with the lawsuit was a graphic of early concept artwork of characters that are claimed to appear similar to major characters from the film, including Nick Wilde, Judy Hopps, Flash and Chief Bogo. A Disney spokesperson described the lawsuit as being &quot;ridden with patently false allegations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;goldmanlawsuit&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/zootopia-lawsuit-disney-copyright-infringement-gary-goldman-1202047892/ |title=Disney Slams &quot;False&quot; 'Zootopia' Big $$ Copyright Suit From 'Total Recall' Scribe |first=Dominic |last=Patten |date=March 21, 2017 |accessdate=March 21, 2017 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321234106/http://deadline.com/2017/03/zootopia-lawsuit-disney-copyright-infringement-gary-goldman-1202047892/ |archivedate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald dismissed the infringement claims on November 8, 2017.
* ''[[The Shape of Water]]'': In February 2018, the estate of [[Paul Zindel]] initiated a lawsuit in [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] against director Guillermo del Toro and associate producer Daniel Kraus, alleging that ''The Shape of Water'' &quot;brazenly copies the story, elements, characters, and themes&quot; of Zindel's 1969 work ''[[Let Me Hear You Whisper (play)|Let Me Hear You Whisper]]'', which depicts a cleaning lady bonding with a dolphin and attempting to rescue it from a secret research laboratory's nefarious uses. In July 2018, Judge Percy Anderson dismissed the suit.
* ''[[Parasite (2019 film)|Parasite]]'': On February 6, 2020, Indian film producer P. L. Thenappan threatened to take legal action against the makers of ''Parasite'' for &quot;story theft&quot; against his 1999 Tamil film ''[[Minsara Kanna]]''. Thenappan and his lawyer had sent a letter seeking an explanation to Bong Joon-ho and the production company that made ''Parasite''. Easwar Kuppusamy, a Madras High Court advocate who is appearing for Thenappan, said, &quot;They can't deny that they have lifted the basic plot [of ''Minsara Kanna'']. There are several films which have similar ideas, but an entire family going to a rich family's house and deceiving them is ''Minsara Kanna''{{'}}s plot. The only difference is that ''Parasite'' doesn't belong to the romantic genre.&quot; Some Tamil netizens agreed that the plot of the film is similar to ''Minsara Kanna''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parasite plagiarism row: Minsara Kanna producer PL Thenappan sends intimation mail |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/parasite-plagiarism-row-minsara-kanna-producer-pl-thenappan-sends-intimation-mail-1647884-2020-02-19 |website=India Today |accessdate=February 22, 2020  |date=February 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[High Society (1955 film)|High Society]]'' (1955) – Withdrawn from screenwriting ballot after being mistaken for the [[High Society (1956 film)|1956 movie]] of the same title.
* ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) – Initially nominated for eleven awards, its nomination for Best Original Score was revoked after it was discovered that its main theme was very similar to music that [[Nino Rota|the score's composer]] had written for an earlier film. None of its other nominations were revoked, and it received three Oscars, including Best Picture.
* ''[[A Place in the World (film)|A Place in the World]]'' (1992) – Removed from the Best Foreign Language Film ballot after it was discovered that the country who submitted the film exercised insufficient artistic control.
* ''[[Tuba Atlantic]]'' (2012) – Removed from the Best Live Action Short Film ballot when it was discovered that the film aired on television before its theatrical release.
* ''[[Alone Yet Not Alone]]'' (2014) – The film's title song, &quot;Alone Yet Not Alone&quot;, was removed from the Best Original Song ballot after [[Bruce Broughton]] was found to have improperly contacted other members of the academy's musical branch; this was the first time that a film was removed from a ballot for ethical reasons.

One film was disqualified after winning the award, and had the winner return the Oscar:
* ''[[Young Americans (1967 film)|Young Americans]]'' (1969) – Initially won the award for Best Documentary Feature, but was later revoked after it was revealed that it had opened theatrically prior to the eligibility period.

==Presenter and performer gifts==
It has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars.

===Reception===
In ''Movie - Film - Review'', ''[[Daily Mail]]'' staffer Christopher Tookey wrote that though the actresses were &quot;competent in roles that may have some reference to their own careers&quot;, the film &quot;is visually unimaginative, never escapes its stage origins, and is almost totally lacking in revelation or surprising incident&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tookey/&gt;  Noting that there were &quot;occasional, refreshing moments of intergenerational bitchiness&quot;, they did not &quot;justify comparisons to ''[[All About Eve]]''&quot;, and were &quot;insufficiently different to deserve critical parallels with ''[[Rashomon]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tookey/&gt; He also wrote that ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the film a &quot;slow, stuffy chamber-piece&quot;, and that ''[[The Evening Standard]]'' stated the film's &quot;best moments exhibit the bitchy tantrums seething beneath the threesome's composed veneers&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tookey&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tookey|first1=Chris|title=review: Actresses / Actrius / Actrices|url=http://www.movie-film-review.com/devFilm.asp?ID=12423|publisher=Movie - Film - Review|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[MRQE]] wrote &quot;This cinematic adaptation of a theatrical work is true to the original, but does not stray far from a theatrical rendering of the story.&quot;&lt;ref name=MRQE&gt;{{cite web|last1=staff|title=Actrius (1997)|url=http://www.mrqe.com/movie_reviews/actrius-m100030469|publisher=[[MRQE]]|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Animalia'' is an [[alliteration|alliterative]] [[alphabet]] book and contains twenty-six illustrations, one for each letter of the alphabet. Each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom (A is for [[alligator]], B is for [[butterfly]], etc.) along with a short poem utilizing the letter of the page for many of the words. The illustrations contain many other objects beginning with that letter that the reader can try to identify. As an additional challenge, the author has hidden a picture of himself as a child in every picture.

'''International Atomic Time''' ('''TAI''', from the French name '''{{lang|fr|temps atomique international}}'''&lt;ref&gt;Temps atomique 1975{{elucidate|date=April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a high-precision [[Atomic clock|atomic]] [[coordinate time|coordinate]] [[time standard]] based on the notional passage of [[proper time]] on [[Earth]]'s [[geoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the International Atomic Time TAI a coordinate time or a proper time? |journal=Celestial Mechanics |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=155–161 |bibcode = 1986CeMec..38..155G|last1 = Guinot|first1 = B.|year=1986 |doi=10.1007/BF01230427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the principal realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (with a fixed offset of [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]). It is also the basis for [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface. {{as of|2017|01|01}}, when another [[leap second]] was added,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulletin C 52&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/bul/bulc/bulletinc.52|first=Christian|last=Bizouard|title=Bulletin C 52|publisher=[[IERS]]|location=Paris|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAI is exactly 37 seconds ahead of UTC. The 37 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 27 leap seconds in UTC since 1972.

TAI may be reported using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both [[Julian Date]]s and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used. TAI in this form was synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.

==Operation==
TAI is a [[weighted average]] of the time kept by over 400 [[atomic clock]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iag.dgfi.tum.de/fileadmin/IAG-docs/Travaux2013/08_BIPM.pdf |title=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) Time Department |publisher=Report of the International Association of Geodesy 2011-2013 |date= |accessdate=11 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time n.d.&quot;&gt;{{cite web 
|title = Time
|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/ 
|publisher = International Bureau of Weights and Measures

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the clocks involved are [[caesium clock]]s; the [[International System of Units]] (SI) definition of the [[second]] is based on [[caesium]].{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=207, 214}} The clocks are compared using [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] signals and [[two-way satellite time and frequency transfer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Circular T&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=Circular T |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] |url=ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/  |access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the [[signal averaging]] TAI is an [[order of magnitude]] more stable than its best constituent clock.

The participating institutions each broadcast, in [[real-time data|real time]], a frequency signal with [[timecode]]s, which is their estimate of TAI.  Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds.  These time scales are denoted in the form ''UTC(NPL)'' in the UTC form, where ''NPL'' in this case identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].  The TAI form may be denoted ''TAI(NPL)''.  The latter is not to be confused with ''TA(NPL)'', which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.

The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time n.d.&quot;/&gt;  This combined time scale is published monthly in &quot;Circular T&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Circular T&quot;/&gt; and is the [[canonical form|canonical]] TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC − UTC(''k'') (equivalent to TAI − TAI(''k'')) for each participating institution ''k''.  The same circular also gives tables of TAI − TA(''k''), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.

Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T, the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight, it is possible to discover errors in TAI and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Since the published circulars are definitive, better estimates do not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).

==History==
Early atomic time scales consisted of [[quartz clock]]s with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL)]]. It was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] and to establish a time scale, called Greenwich Atomic (GA). The [[United States Naval Observatory]] began the A.1 scale on 13 September 1956, using an [[Atomichron]] commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the [[National Bureau of Standards]], [[Boulder, Colorado]] on 9 October 1957.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=199–200}}

The [[International Time Bureau]] (BIH) began a time scale, T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of [[VLF]] radio signals. The BIH scale, A.1, and NBS-A were defined by an [[Epoch (date reference)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958{{efn|They were set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding [[UT2]] instant. However, each observatory used its own value of UT2.{{sfn|Guinot|2000|page=181}}}} The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: &quot;A3&quot; in 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Steve |title=The epoch of TAI is 1961-01-01T20:00:00 UT2 |url=https://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/taiepoch.html |publisher=UCO/Lick Observatory |quote=By 1964 BIH realized that some atomic chronometers were much better than others, and they constructed A3 based on the best 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;TA(BIH)&quot; in 1969.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=200–201}}

The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967. From 1971 to 1975 the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] and the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] made a series of decisions which designated the BIPM time scale International Atomic Time (TAI).{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=203–204}} 

In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI scale, therefore, corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the [[geoid]]).  Because the clocks were, on average, well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed by about one part in a trillion.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name ''EAL'' (''Echelle Atomique Libre'', meaning ''Free Atomic Scale'').{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=215}}

The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT), which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brumberg|first1=V.A.|last2=Kopeikin|first2=S.M.|title=Relativistic time scales in the solar system|journal=[[Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy]]|issn=0923-2958|volume=48|issue=1|pages=23–44|date=March 1990|doi=10.1007/BF00050674|bibcode=1990CeMDA..48...23B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.{{efn|The 32.184 second offset is to provide continuity with the older [[ephemeris time]].}} TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184&amp;nbsp;s.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=218&amp;ndash;219}}

The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated, &quot;In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Relation to UTC==
UTC is a [[discontinuous]] time scale. It is regularly adjusted by leap seconds. Between these adjustments, it is composed of segments that are linear transformations of atomic time. From its beginning in 1961 through December 1971, the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that UTC approximated [[UT2]].  Afterwards, these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate [[UT1]].  This was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale; the post-1971 more linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally. The fact that it continues to approximate UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of UTC.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=227&amp;ndash;229}}

[[File:Belisaire demandant l'aumone Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|Giving [[alms]] to the poor is often considered an altruistic action.]]

'''Altruism''' is the [[moral principle|principle]] and [[moral courage|moral practice]] of concern for [[happiness]] of other [[human kind|human beings]] or animals, resulting in a [[quality of life]] both [[material]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]]. It is a traditional [[virtue]] in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of &quot;others&quot; toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. In an extreme case, altruism may become a synonym of selflessness, which is the opposite of [[selfishness]].

The word &quot;altruism&quot; was coined by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in French, as ''altruisme'', for an [[antonym]] of [[egoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=altruism (n .) |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper |access-date=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Teske |first1=Nathan |title=Political Activists in America: The Identity Construction Model of Political Participation |date=2009|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |location=University Park, Pa. |isbn=9780271035468|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7B38I2UEPa0C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived it from the Italian ''altrui'', which in turn was derived from Latin ''alteri'', meaning &quot;[[alterity|other people]]&quot; or &quot;somebody else&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ciciloni|first1=Ferdinando|title=A Grammar of the Italian Language|date=1825|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/agrammaritalian00cicigoog/page/n81 64]|url=https://archive.org/details/agrammaritalian00cicigoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruism in [[Biology|biological]] observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action. Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is &quot;intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Altruism in medicine: its definition, nature, and dilemmas|last = Steinberg|first = David|date = 2010|journal = Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=249–57|doi = 10.1017/s0963180109990521|pmid = 20226108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one sense, the opposite of altruism is [[Spite (sentiment)|spite]]; a spiteful action harms another with no self-benefit.

Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of [[loyalty]], in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider relationships. Much debate exists as to whether ''&quot;true&quot;'' altruism is possible in human psychology. The theory of [[psychological egoism]] suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal [[gratification]]. The validity of this argument depends on whether [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic rewards]] qualify as &quot;benefits&quot;.

The term ''[[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]'' may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with [[ethical egoism|egoism]], which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first. [[Effective altruism]] is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.

==The notion of altruism==
The concept has a long history in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Ethics|ethical]] thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher of science]], [[Auguste Comte]], and has become a major topic for [[psychologists]] (especially [[evolutionary psychology]] researchers), [[evolutionary biologists]], and [[ethology|ethologists]]. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.

==Scientific viewpoints&lt;!--linked from 'Evolution of morality'--&gt;==
===Anthropology===
{{See also|Alms|Altruism (ethics)}}
[[Marcel Mauss]]'s book ''The Gift'' contains a passage called &quot;Note on alms&quot;. This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand, and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Evolutionary explanations===
{{Main|Altruism in animals|Evolution of morality|Evolutionary ethics}}
[[File:Manner of Francis Wheatley, Giving alms to beggar children.jpg|thumb|upright|Giving alms to beggar children]]
In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Bell| first = Graham| title = Selection: the mechanism of evolution| url = https://archive.org/details/selectionmechani00bell_664| url-access = limited| year = 2008| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| isbn = 978-0-19-856972-5| pages = [https://archive.org/details/selectionmechani00bell_664/page/n381 367]–368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[evolutionary psychology]] this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, [[Tip (gratuity)|tipping]], courtship gifts, production of [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s, and [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AEP1&quot;&gt;Pat Barcaly. The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation. In {{Cite book | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from [[evolutionary game theory]] a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies.

Some of the proposed mechanisms are:
* [[Kin selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Biological Altruism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/#2|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Okasha|first=Samir|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures. Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior. One kinship cue is facial resemblance. One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons. Another cue is having the same family name, especially if rare, and this has been found to increase helpful behavior. Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group. Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study. This effect was especially strong for firstborns, who are typically close to their families.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* Vested interests. People are likely to suffer if their friends, allies, and similar social [[ingroup]]s suffer or even disappear. Helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist. Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness. Extreme self-sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] threatens to kill the entire ingroup.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* [[Reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/406755|last1=Trivers|first1=R.L.|year=1971|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|pages=35–57|url=https://www.academia.edu/1591793}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Reciprocity (evolution)]].
** Direct [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.7466396 |author=R Axelrod and WD Hamilton |title=The evolution of cooperation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=211 |issue=4489 |date=27 March 1981 |pages=1390–1396 |pmid=7466396 |bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1390A|citeseerx=10.1.1.147.9644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help. The effective [[tit for tat]] strategy is one [[game theory|game theoretic]] example. Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future. People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower. They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors. Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a &quot;Community Game&quot; instead of a &quot;Wall Street Game&quot;.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them. This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity. Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation. The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped. On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating. People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts. As such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first. This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population. Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
** Indirect reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature04131|author=Martin Nowak &amp; Karl Sigmund|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=437|issue=27|date=October 2005|pages=1291–1298|pmid=16251955|bibcode = 2005Natur.437.1291N |url=https://www.academia.edu/17949833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a person's [[reputation]] to become very important. A person with a good reputation for reciprocity has a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
** [[Strong reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gintis |first=Herbert |author-link=Herbert Gintis|title=Strong Reciprocity and Human Sociality|journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]]|volume=206|issue=2|date=September 2000|pmid=10966755|pages=169–179|doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2111|hdl=10419/105717|hdl-access=free|citeseerx=10.1.1.335.7226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism. A number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence.
** Pseudo-reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2003|title=Genetic and Cultural Evolution of Cooperation, Chapter 11|isbn=978-0-262-08326-3|publisher=Dahlem Workshop Reports|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist.
* [[Signalling theory|Costly signaling]] and the [[handicap principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/3677205|last1=Zahavi|first1=A.|year=1995|title=Altruism as a handicap – The limitations of kin selection and reciprocity|jstor=3677205|journal=Avian Biol|volume=26|issue=1|pages=1–3|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245271476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an &quot;honest signal&quot; of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources. This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner. It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling. It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long-term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help. Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits, resources, and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else. Similarly, holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one's resources. Heroic risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt; Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic. People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;AEP2&quot;&gt;Wendy Iredal and Mark van Vugt.

:Women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners. When looking for a long-term partner, altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children. It has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman. While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man. Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;&lt;ref name=AEP2/&gt;

:People may compete for social benefit from a burnished reputation, which may cause [[competitive altruism]]. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as [[psychopathy]] or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Explicit [[extrinsic]] rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* [[Group selection]]. It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as [[David Sloan Wilson]] that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level. Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons. Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (See also [[in-group favoritism]]). Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Neyfakh

[[File:Helping the homeless (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|Helping the [[Homelessness|homeless]] in New York City]]
Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their [[inclusive fitness]] when they are doing altruistic acts. Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment. This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]'s development of the [[Price equation]], which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides''. These protists live as individual [[amoeba]]e until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.

Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1701_01 |last1=Brown |first1=S.L. |last2=Brown |first2=R.M. |year=2006 |title=Selective investment theory: Recasting the functional significance of close relationships |url=http://icos.groups.si.umich.edu/Brown-Stephanie.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714230521/http://icos.groups.si.umich.edu/Brown-Stephanie.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 July 2014 |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=17 |pages=1–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] in his 1902 book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' and [[Peter Singer]] in his book ''[[A Darwinian Left]]''.

===Neurobiology===
Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the [[National Institutes of Health]] and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. In their research, published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA in October 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Human fronto–mesolimbic networks guide decisions about charitable donation, PNAS 2006:103(42);15623–15628&lt;/ref&gt; they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/[[septal region]]. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain&quot;&gt;{{cite news

In fact, in an experiment published in March 2007 at the [[University of Southern California]] neuroscientist [[Antonio R. Damasio]] and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that when confronted with moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with &quot;end-justifies-the-means&quot; answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue – in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city – these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains. According to [[Adrian Raine]], a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study's implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: &quot;Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse. Without that awareness, people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets. Does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brain&quot;/&gt;

In another study, in the 1990s, Dr. Bill Harbaugh, a [[University of Oregon]] economist, concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fMRI scanner test in 2007 with his psychologist colleague Dr. Ulrich Mayr, reached the same conclusions of Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman about giving to charity, although they were able to divide the study group into two groups: &quot;egoists&quot; and &quot;altruists&quot;. One of their discoveries was that, though rarely, even some of the considered &quot;egoists&quot; sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others, leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity, such as a person's environment and values.&lt;ref name=&quot;neurons&quot;/&gt;

===Psychology===
The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines ''psychological altruism'' as &quot;a motivational state with the goal of increasing another's welfare&quot;. Psychological altruism is contrasted with ''psychological egoism'', which refers to the motivation to increase one's own welfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|article=Altruism|encyclopedia = International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|editor-first= William A. |editor-last = Darity, Jr.|edition= 2nd |volume = 1|location = Detroit|publisher = Macmillan Reference USA|date= 2008|pages = 87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism.&lt;ref name=&quot;batson3&quot;&gt;[Batson, C. (2011). Altruism in humans. New York, NY US: Oxford University Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref name=&quot;prosocial&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Batson|first= C.

The [[social exchange theory]] postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self.&lt;ref name=&quot;noaltruism&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maner | first1 = J.

He identified four major motives: to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle ([[principlism]]). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless.&lt;ref name=&quot;baston2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batson|first1= C.

Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions.

In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service.&lt;ref name=&quot;prosocial&quot;/&gt; Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the ''[[Bystander effect]]''). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson | first1 = James M. | last2 = Bruckman | first2 = Amy S. | year = 2004 | title = The Bystander Effect: A Lens for Understanding Patterns of Participation | journal = Journal of the Learning Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 165–195 | doi = 10.1207/s15327809jls1302_2 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.72.4881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

===Sociology===

&quot;Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society&quot; (&quot;Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity&quot;. American Sociological Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/sections/altruism.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503051933/http://asanet.org/sections/altruism.cfm|url-status=dead|title=American Sociological Association: Altruism, Morality and Social Solidarity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|archivedate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field. The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges [[public sociology]] saying, &quot;The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable&quot; (&quot;Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity&quot; ASA). This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies. How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and &quot;build the good society&quot;.

===Pathological altruism===
[[Pathology|Pathological]] altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme, and either harms the altruistic person, or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good.

The term &quot;pathological altruism&quot; was popularised by the book ''[[Pathological Altruism]]''.

Examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs, hoarding of animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/pathological-altruism-9780199738571?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Pathological Altruism|date=19 December 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199738571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious viewpoints==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}
Most, if not all, of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Sikhism]], etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.

===Buddhism===
[[File:Monks collecting alms - Bun Vat Phu.JPG|thumb|Monks collecting alms]]
Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism. Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. &quot;Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being&quot; ([[Dalai Lama]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech by the Dalai Lama&quot;&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm Speech by the Dalai Lama] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003223717/http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm |date=3 October 2009 }}&lt;br&gt;The phrase &quot;core of our being&quot; is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von Wülfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | pages = 226–244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: &quot;The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes&quot; (Dalai Lama&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech by the Dalai Lama&quot;/&gt;).

In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.

===Jainism===
{{see also|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[File:Ahinsa.jpg|thumb|Sculpture depicting the Jain concept of ''ahimsa'' (non-injury)]]
The fundamental principles of [[Jainism]] revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of ''[[Ahimsa]]'' – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabhdev]], introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.

Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment.

Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:
# Non-violence (Ahimsa);
# Truthfulness (Satya);
# Non-stealing (Asteya);
# Celibacy ([[Brahmacharya]]);
# [[Non-possession]] or non-materialism (Aparigraha);
The &quot;great vows&quot; ([[Mahavrata]]) are prescribed for monks and &quot;limited vows&quot; ([[Anuvrata]]) are prescribed for householders. The house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows. The monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.

The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become ''Siddha'' ([[God in Jainism]]). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.

===Christianity===
Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the [[Gospel]], especially in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. From biblical to medieval [[Christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of &quot;disinterested love&quot;, as in the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] phrase &quot;love seeks not its own interests&quot;. In his book ''Indoctrination and Self-deception,'' Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.

[[St Thomas Aquinas]] interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself'&lt;ref&gt;[[Leviticus]] 19 and Matthew 22&lt;/ref&gt; as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'', II:II Quaestio 25, Article 4&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that &quot;the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship&quot; and quotes Aristotle that &quot;the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] IX.4 1166a1&lt;/ref&gt; he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.

Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God. [[Thomas Jay Oord]] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.

German philosopher [[Max Scheler]] distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, &quot;motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one's own life and existence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way is merely &quot;one of the many modern substitutes for love,&amp;nbsp;... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people's business&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its worst, Scheler says, &quot;love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]], the concept 'ithaar' (إيثار) (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by [[Allah]] (i.e. God) on the human body, considered to be property of Allah alone. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; [[Islam]] considers those practicing Eyaar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = M| title = Key Concepts in the Practice of Sufism: Emerald Hills of the Heart| year = 2004| publisher = Fountain| location = Rutherford, N.J.| isbn = 978-1-932099-75-1| pages = 10–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence. A constant concern for Allah results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Neusner| first = Jacob Eds| title = Altruism in World Religions| year = 2005| publisher = Georgetown Univ. Press| location = Washington, D.C.| isbn = 978-1-58901-065-9| pages = 79–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like [[Rabia al-Adawiyya]] who paid attention to the difference between dedication to Allah and dedication to people. Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet [[Yunus Emre]] explained this philosophy as &quot;Yaratılanı severiz, Yaratandan ötürü&quot; or &quot;We love the creature, because of The Creator.&quot; For many Muslims, i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays. However, i'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times.

===Judaism===
Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author2=Ben Zion Bokser |last1=Kook |first1=Abraham Isaac| title = Abraham Isaac Kook: The lights of penitence, The moral principles, Lights of holiness, essays, letters, and poems|url=https://archive.org/details/abrahamisaackook00benz |url-access=registration | year = 1978| publisher = Paulist Press| isbn = 978-0-8091-2159-5| pages = [https://archive.org/details/abrahamisaackook00benz/page/135 135–136]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is defined as [[Tzedakah|bestowal]], or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God. [[Kabbalah]] defines God as the force of giving in [[existence]]. Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Luzzatto| first = Moshe Ḥayyim| title = The way of God| year = 1997| publisher = Feldheim Publishers| isbn = 978-0-87306-769-0| pages = 37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], in his writings about the [[future generation]], focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 978-965-7065-34-1| pages = 120–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 978-965-7065-34-1| pages = 175–180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness. The concept of ''seva'', or [[selfless service]] to the community for its own sake, is an important concept in Sikhism.&lt;ref name=&quot;DictofSikhism&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/APopularDictionaryOfSikhism |title=A Popular Dictionary of Sikhism |publisher=Curzon Press|author1=Cole, W. Owen |author2=Sambhi, Piara Singh |pages=[https://archive.org/details/APopularDictionaryOfSikhism/page/n46 38]–39, 84 |date=1990|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth Nanak, Guru Arjun Dev, sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the Guru Granth. The ninth Guru, Tegh Bahadur, sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. In the late seventeenth century, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] Ji (the tenth [[guru]] in Sikhism), was in war with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh, [[Bhai Kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;GobindSingh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofthesikh025030mbp/page/n7 |title=A History of the Sikhs |publisher=Oxford University Press|author= Joseph Davey Cunningham |date=1918 |page=ix |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield. &quot;What were you doing, and why?&quot; asked the Guru. &quot;I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them&quot;, replied Bhai Kanhaiya. The Guru responded, &quot;Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru.&quot;

It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = O. P. Ralhan| title = The great gurus of the Sikhs| year = 1997| publisher = Anmol Publications Pvt Ltd.| location = New Delhi| isbn = 978-81-7488-479-4| page = 253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism Selflessness (Atmatyag), Love (Prema), Kindness (Daya) and Forgiveness (Kshama) are considered as the highest acts of humanity or &quot;Manushyattva&quot;. Giving alms to the beggers or poor people is considered as a divine act or &quot;Punya&quot; and Hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or &quot;Paapa&quot; and will led them to heaven or &quot;Swarga&quot; in afterlife. Altruism is also the central act of various Hindu mythology and religious poems and songs.

[[Swami Vivekananda]], the legendary Hindu monk, has said -&quot;Jive prem kare jeijon, Seijon sebiche Iswar&quot; (Whoever loves any living being, is serving god.). Mass donation of clothes to poor people (Vastraseva), or blood donation camp or mass food donation (Annaseva) for poor people is common in various Hindu religious ceremonies.

[[Swami Sivananda]], an [[Advaita]] scholar, reiterates the views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the [[Brahma Sutras]], a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[Merit (Buddhism)|punya]], which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.

However the very well known and popular text, the [[Bhagavad Gita]] supports the doctrine of karma yoga (achieving oneness with God through action) &amp; &quot;nishkaama karma&quot; or action without expectation / desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism. Altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in Hindu literature and is central to Hindu morality.&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda, Swami. ''Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8'', Sutras 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{main|Altruism (ethics)}}

There exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of [[Altruism (ethics)|ethical altruism]] maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is [[ethical egoism]], which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with [[utilitarianism]], which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.

A related concept in [[descriptive ethics]] is [[psychological egoism]], the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. [[Rational egoism]] is the view that [[rationality]] consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).

===Effective altruism===
{{Main|Effective altruism}}
[[Effective altruism]] is a [[philosophy]] and [[social movement]] that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacAskill|first1=William|title=Effective Altruism: Introduction|journal=Essays in Philosophy|date= 31 January 2017|volume=18|issue=1|page=2|doi=10.7710/1526-0569.1580|language=en|issn=1526-0569}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact, based upon their values.&lt;ref name=&quot;vox&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8457895/givewell-open-philanthropy-charity|title = You have $8 billion.

Born and educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1935 and 1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, ''[[The Fountainhead]]''. In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own [[Objectivist periodicals|periodicals]] and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.

Rand advocated [[reason]] as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected [[faith]] and religion. She supported [[Rational egoism|rational]] and [[ethical egoism]] and rejected [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]]. In politics, she condemned the [[initiation of force]] as immoral&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barry|1987|p=122}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=309–314}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=298}}; {{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|p=91}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and opposed [[collectivism]] and [[statism]] as well as [[anarchism]], instead supporting ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], which she defined as the system based on recognizing [[individual rights]], including property rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;rights&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|pp=91–92}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=379–380}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In art, Rand promoted [[romantic realism]]. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[classical liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1977|pp=18–20}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=12, 118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;growing&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marcus|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Badhwar 2010&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Objectivist movement]] attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;reception&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She has been a significant influence among [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]].&lt;ref name=&quot;politicalinfluence&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=107–108, 124}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Early life===
Rand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum ({{lang-ru|Алиса Зиновьевна Розенбаум}}) on February 2, 1905, to a [[Russian-Jewish]] bourgeois family living in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=xiii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the eldest of three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and Anna Borisovna (née Kaplan). Her father was an upwardly mobile pharmacist and her mother was socially ambitious and religiously observant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=3–5}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=2–3}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand later said she found school unchallenging and began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the prestigious {{interlanguage link|Stoiunina Gymnasium|ru|Гимназия М. Н. Стоюниной}}, her closest friend was [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s younger sister, Olga. The two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the [[Nabokov House|Nabokov mansion]]: while Olga defended [[constitutional monarchy]], Alisa supported [[republicanism|republican ideals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=69, 367–368}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was twelve at the time of the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, during which she favored [[Alexander Kerensky]] over [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II]]. The subsequent [[October Revolution]] and the rule of the [[Bolsheviks]] under [[Vladimir Lenin]] disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father's business was confiscated, and the family fled to the [[Crimean Peninsula]], which was initially under control of the [[White Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. While in high school, she concluded that she was an [[atheist]] and valued [[reason]] above any other human virtue. After graduating from high school in the Crimea in June 1921, she returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=35–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=14–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spb 06-2012 University Embankment 06.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Twelve Collegia of what was then Petrograd State University|Rand completed a three-year program at [[Petrograd State University]].]]
After the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing her to be in the first group of women to enroll at [[Petrograd State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16, she began her studies in the department of [[social pedagogy]], majoring in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the university she was introduced to the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1999|pp=5–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=41}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=451–460}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She also studied the philosophical works of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17–18, 22–24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Able to read French, German and Russian, she also discovered the writers [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Edmond Rostand]], and [[Friedrich Schiller]], who became her perennial favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17, 22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with many other bourgeois students, she was purged from the university shortly before graduating. After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, however, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which she did in October 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1999|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She then studied for a year at the State [[Tekhnikum|Technicum]] for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For an assignment, she wrote an essay about the Polish actress [[Pola Negri]], which became her first published work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller49-50&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=49–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, she had decided her professional surname for writing would be ''Rand'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly because it is graphically similar to a vowelless excerpt {{lang|ru|Рзнб}} of her birth surname in [[Cyrillic]] handwriting,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and she adopted the first name ''Ayn'', either from a [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] name ''[[Aino (given name)|Aino]]'' or from the [[Hebrew]] word {{lang|he| עין}} (''[[ayin]]'', meaning &quot;eye&quot;).{{efn|Rand said the origin of ''Ayn'' was Finnish,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995b|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but some biographical sources question this, suggesting it may come from a Hebrew nickname.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=55–57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Arrival in the United States===
[[File:Pola Negri by Ayn Rand cover.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A brown book cover with black-and-white drawings and text in Russian. The drawing on the left is a portrait of a woman with dark hair; the drawing on the right is of skyscrapers.|Cover of Rand's first published work, a 2,500-word monograph on actress [[Pola Negri]] published in 1925&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller49-50&quot;/&gt;]]
In late 1925, Rand was granted a [[Travel visa|visa]] to visit relatives in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=32}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=18–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She departed on January 17, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=50–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When she arrived in New York City on February 19, 1926, she was so impressed with the skyline of [[Manhattan]] that she cried what she later called &quot;tears of splendor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with her relatives, one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films free of charge. She then left for [[Hollywood]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=57–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hollywood, a chance meeting with famed director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] led to work as an [[Extra (acting)|extra]] in his film ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=34–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While working on ''The King of Kings'', she met an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor; the two were married on April 15, 1929. She became a [[Green card|permanent American resident]] in July 1929 and [[United States nationality law#Naturalization|an American citizen]] on March 3, 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=39}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at [[RKO]] Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=35–40}}; {{harvnb|Paxton|1998|pp=74, 81, 84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=96–98}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=43–44, 52}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early fiction===
{{see also|Night of January 16th|We the Living|Anthem (novella)}}
Rand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay ''[[Red Pawn]]'' to [[Universal Studios]] in 1932, although it was never produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=40, 42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the courtroom drama ''[[Night of January 16th]]'', first produced by [[E. E. Clive]] in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1935. Each night a jury was selected from members of the audience; based on the jury's vote, one of two different endings would be performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=76, 92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, [[Paramount Pictures]] produced a [[The Night of January 16th (film)|movie loosely based on the play]]. Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=78}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ideal (novel)|Ideal]]'' is a novel and play written in 1934 which were first published in 2015 by her estate. The heroine is an actress who embodies Randian ideals.&lt;ref name=NYT81015&gt;{{harvnb|Kakutani|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's first published novel, the semi-autobiographical ''[[We the Living]]'', was published in 1936. Set in [[Soviet Russia]], it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that ''We the Living'' &quot;is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995a|p=xviii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although European editions continued to sell.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, without Rand's knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, ''Noi vivi'' and ''Addio, Kira''. Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as ''[[We the Living (film)|We the Living]]'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her novella ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel, ''The Fountainhead''. It presents a vision of a [[dystopian]] future world in which [[totalitarian]] collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with ''We the Living'', Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5&amp;nbsp;million copies.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''Anthem''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005a|pp=24–27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Fountainhead'' and political activism===

During the 1940s, Rand became politically active. She and her husband worked as full-time volunteers for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican [[Wendell Willkie]]. This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences; she enjoyed fielding sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had viewed pro-Willkie [[newsreels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This activity brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist [[Henry Hazlitt]] and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her. Mises once referred to Rand as &quot;the most courageous man in America&quot;, a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said &quot;man&quot; instead of &quot;woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=114}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=249}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=188–189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand also became friends with libertarian writer [[Isabel Paterson]]. Rand questioned Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their many meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only [[non-fiction]] book, ''[[The God of the Machine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=75–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Fountain Head (1943 1st ed) - Ayn Rand.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Fountainhead]]'', first edition]]

Rand's first major success as a writer came in 1943 with ''The Fountainhead'', a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=61–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named [[Howard Roark]] and his struggle against what Rand described as &quot;second-handers&quot;—those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=58–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the [[amphetamine]] [[Benzedrine]] to fight fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=85}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=178}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=304–305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Fountainhead'' became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=149}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Rand sold the rights for a [[The Fountainhead (film)|film version]] to [[Warner Bros.]] and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated ''[[Love Letters (1945 film)|Love Letters]]'' and ''[[You Came Along]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=68–80}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=183–198}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand also worked on other projects, including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called ''The Moral Basis of Individualism''. Although the planned book was never completed, a condensed version was published as an essay titled &quot;The Only Path to Tomorrow&quot; in the January 1944 edition of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=171}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Ayn Rand's testimony before the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities}}
Rand extended her involvement with free-market and [[anti-communist]] activism while working in Hollywood. She became involved with the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]], a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist [[American Writers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=100–101, 123}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments, which Rand considered rude, to valued political allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=130–131}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=214–215}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, during the [[Second Red Scare]], Rand testified as a &quot;friendly witness&quot; before the United States [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the [[Soviet Union]] and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film ''[[Song of Russia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|pp=91–93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as much better and happier than it actually was.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|pp=188–189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=125}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as &quot;futile&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After several delays, the film version of ''The Fountainhead'' was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she &quot;disliked the movie from beginning to end&quot;, and complained about its editing, acting, and other elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Atlas Shrugged'' and Objectivism===

[[File:Famous fantastic mysteries 195306.jpg|thumb|upright|Rand's novella ''Anthem'' was reprinted in the June 1953 issue of the pulp magazine ''[[Famous Fantastic Mysteries]]''.]]
In the years following the publication of ''The Fountainhead'', Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book profoundly influenced. In 1951, Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated &quot;The Collective&quot;) included future [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Alan Greenspan]], a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later [[Nathaniel Branden]]) and his wife [[Barbara Branden|Barbara]], and Barbara's cousin [[Leonard Peikoff]]. Initially the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. She later began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, ''Atlas Shrugged'', as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954, Rand's close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the &quot;grudging consent&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brandenobit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Nathaniel Branden dies at 84; acolyte and lover of Ayn Rand|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-nathaniel-branden-20141209-story.html|website=LA Times|accessdate=May 13, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; of their spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=256–264, 331–343}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Atlas Shrugged'', published in 1957, was considered Rand's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=113}}; {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand described the theme of the novel as &quot;the role of the mind in man's existence—and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Salmieri, Gregory. &quot;''Atlas Shrugged'' on the Role of the Mind in Man's Existence&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2009|p=248}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism]] and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a [[dystopia]]n United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists respond to a [[welfare state]] government by going on [[Strike action|strike]] and retreating to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, [[John Galt]], describes the strike as &quot;stopping the motor of the world&quot; by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], [[Romance novel|romance]], and [[science fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McConnell|2010|p=507}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it contains an extended exposition of Objectivism in the form of a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.&lt;ref&gt;Stolyarov II, G. &quot;The Role and Essence of John Galt's Speech in Ayn Rand's ''Atlas Shrugged''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Younkins|2007|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Atlas Shrugged dust jacket (1957 1st ed).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.9|First-edition [[dust jacket]] of ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'']]

Despite many negative reviews, ''Atlas Shrugged'' became an international bestseller. In an interview with [[Mike Wallace]], Rand declared herself &quot;the most creative thinker alive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rand was discouraged and depressed by the reaction of intellectuals to the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=178}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=303–306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Atlas Shrugged'' was Rand's last completed work of fiction; it marked the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASturningpoint&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2000|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Younkins|2007|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Baker|1987|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1958, Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for [[Objectivist periodicals]] that she edited. Rand later published some of these articles in book form.

Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, later described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the [[Objectivist movement]] itself as a [[cult]] or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=105–106}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=232–233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=236–237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some former NBI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated, and the problem was concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=235}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=303}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=237–238}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=329}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as [[Yale]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=315–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard]], and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She received an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Humane Letters|Doctorate of Humane Letters]] from [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] on 2 October 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=318}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She also began delivering annual lectures at the [[Ford Hall Forum]], responding afterward to questions from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During these speeches and Q&amp;A sessions, she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day. These included supporting abortion rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=320–321}}.&lt;/ref&gt; opposing the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[military draft]] (but condemning many [[draft dodgers]] as &quot;bums&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=228–229, 265}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=352}}.&lt;/ref&gt; supporting [[Israel]] in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as &quot;civilized men fighting savages&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|2005|p=96}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=266}}.&lt;/ref&gt; saying [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] had the right to develop land taken from [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=266}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=391}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and calling [[homosexuality]] &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot;, while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=362, 519}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She also endorsed several [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates for President of the United States, most strongly [[Barry Goldwater]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for ''The Objectivist Newsletter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=204–206}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=322–323}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ayn Rand Marker.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Twin gravestone bearing the names &quot;Frank O'Connor&quot; and &quot;Ayn Rand O'Connor&quot;|Grave marker for Rand and her husband at [[Kensico Cemetery]] in [[Valhalla, New York]]]]
In 1964, Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress [[Patrecia Scott]], whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens, which led to the closure of NBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=344–358}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand published an article in ''The Objectivist'' repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other &quot;irrational behavior in his private life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=378–379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=386–389}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand underwent surgery for [[lung cancer]] in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=391–393}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, after her initial objections, she allowed social worker Evva Pryor, an employee of her attorney, to enroll her in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McConnell|2010|pp=520–521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiss|2012|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=392–395}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=406}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand died of [[heart failure]] on March 6, 1982, at her home in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=410}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was interred in the [[Kensico Cemetery]], [[Valhalla, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=405, 410}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including [[Alan Greenspan]]. A {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=403}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In her will, Rand named Leonard Peikoff to inherit her estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=400}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{Objectivist movement}}
{{main|Objectivism}}
Rand called her philosophy &quot;Objectivism&quot;, describing its essence as &quot;the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–1171}}&lt;/ref&gt; She considered Objectivism a [[systematic philosophy]] and laid out positions on [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[political philosophy]], and [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=2–3}}; {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|p=224}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|Sciabarra|1999|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In metaphysics, Rand supported [[philosophical realism]], and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Den Uyl, Douglas J. &amp; Rasmussen, Douglas B. &quot;Ayn Rand's Realism&quot;. In {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|pp=3–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[epistemology]], she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered [[axiom]]atic,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=38–39}}; {{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[reason]], which she described as &quot;the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected all claims of non-perceptual or ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' knowledge, including {{&quot; '}}instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing{{' &quot;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=62–63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In her ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]'', Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the [[analytic–synthetic dichotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salmieri|Gotthelf|2005|p=1997}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=85–86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ethics, Rand argued for [[Rational egoism|rational]] and [[ethical egoism]] (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle. She said the individual should &quot;exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1989|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She referred to egoism as &quot;the virtue of selfishness&quot; in her [[The Virtue of Selfishness|book of that title]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kukathas&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kukathas|1998|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which she presented her solution to the [[is-ought problem]] by describing a [[meta-ethical]] theory that based morality in the needs of &quot;man's survival ''qua'' man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2010}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=207, 219}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness,&lt;ref name=&quot;Badhwar 2010&quot;/&gt; and held that the [[initiation of force]] was evil and irrational, writing in ''Atlas Shrugged'' that &quot;Force and mind are opposites.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1023}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=313–320}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's political philosophy emphasized [[individual rights]] (including [[Private property|property rights]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=350–352}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and she considered ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;rights&quot;/&gt; She opposed [[statism]], which she understood to include [[theocracy]], [[absolute monarchy]], [[Nazism]], [[fascism]], [[communism]], [[democratic socialism]], and [[dictatorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=369}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although her political views are often classified as [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] or [[libertarian]], she preferred the term &quot;radical for capitalism&quot;. She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=174–177, 209, 230–231}}; {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|pp=225–226}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=189–190}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=252}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with [[anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=266–267}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=268–269}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in [[subjectivism]] that could only lead to collectivism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=280–281}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=371–372}}; {{harvnb|Merrill|1991|p=139}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In aesthetics, Rand defined art as a &quot;selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments&quot;. According to her, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=204–205}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature, where she considered [[romanticism]] to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=428}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She described her own approach to literature as &quot;[[romantic realism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=207}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=437}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand acknowledged [[Aristotle]] as her greatest influence&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1171}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remarked that in the [[history of philosophy]] she could only recommend &quot;three A's&quot;—Aristotle, [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]], and Ayn Rand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sciabarra1995p12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1959 interview with [[Mike Wallace]], when asked where her philosophy came from she responded: &quot;Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of my philosophy myself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podritske|Schwartz|2009|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she also found early inspiration in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=16, 22}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=100–106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=24–25}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|pp=136, 138–139}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in passages from the first edition of ''We the Living'' (which Rand later revised),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|1991|pp=38–39}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|p=135}}; Loiret-Prunet, Valerie. &quot;Ayn Rand and Feminist Synthesis: Rereading ''We the Living''&quot;.

Rand considered her philosophical opposite to be [[Immanuel Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1971|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom she referred to as “the most evil man in mankind’s history”,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1971|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily for his philosophy regarding the limitations of reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rand |first1=Ayn |title=For The New Intellectual |date=1961 |publisher=Random House |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her &quot;theory of concepts, ethics, and discovery in politics that evil—the violation of rights—consists of the initiation of force&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|2005|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed [[epistemology]] was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution|chapter=The Left: Old and New|page=62|isbn=978-0-452-01184-7|oclc=39281836|year=1999|location=New York|publisher=Meridian|last=Rand|first=Ayn|others=Edited by Peter Schwartz|title-link=Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating: &quot;I am not ''primarily'' an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not ''primarily'' an advocate of egoism, but of reason.

===Critical reception===
During Rand's lifetime, her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation. Rand's first novel, ''We the Living'', was admired by the literary critic [[H. L. Mencken]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=33}}; Ralston, Richard E. &quot;Publishing ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; her Broadway play ''Night of January 16th'' was both a critical and popular success,&lt;ref name=&quot;Branden 122-124&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=122–124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Fountainhead'' was hailed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer [[Lorine Pruette]] as &quot;masterful&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pruette&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Lorine|last=Pruette|author-link=Lorine Livingston Pruette|work=The New York Times|date=May 16, 1943|title=Battle Against Evil|page=BR7|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/05/16/archives/battle-against-evil-the-fountainhead-by-ayn-rand-754-pp.html|accessdate=April 15, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511114039/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20610FD3D5C167B93C4A8178ED85F478485F9|archivedate=May 11, 2011|url-status=live}} Reprinted in {{cite book|title=Books of the Century|editor-first=Charles|editor-last=McGrath|year=1998|location=New York|publisher=Times Books|isbn=978-0-8129-2965-2|oclc=38439024|pages=[https://archive.org/details/booksofcentury00newy/page/135 135–136]|url=https://archive.org/details/booksofcentury00newy/page/135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;/&gt; However, they became [[bestseller]]s largely through word of mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reviews Rand received were for ''Night of January 16th''. Reviews of the production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Branden 122-124&quot;/&gt; Rand believed that her first novel, ''We the Living'', was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner writes &quot;it was the most reviewed of any of her works&quot;, with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;Reviews of ''We the Living''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|pp=147–151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Her 1938 novella ''Anthem'' received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;Reviews of ''Anthem''&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005a|pp=55–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's first bestseller, ''The Fountainhead'', received far fewer reviews than ''We the Living'', and reviewers' opinions were mixed.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;''The Fountainhead'' Reviews&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2006|pp=77–82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorine Pruette's positive review in ''The New York Times'' was one that Rand greatly appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=152}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pruette called Rand &quot;a writer of great power&quot; who wrote &quot;brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly&quot;, and stated that &quot;you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pruette&quot;/&gt; There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;/&gt; Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;/&gt; such as one that called it &quot;a whale of a book&quot; and another that said &quot;anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing&quot;. Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style &quot;offensively pedestrian&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfreviews&quot;/&gt;

Rand's 1957 novel ''Atlas Shrugged'' was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asreviews&quot;&gt;Berliner, Michael S. &quot;The ''Atlas Shrugged'' Reviews&quot;. In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2009|pp=133–137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[National Review]]'', conservative author [[Whittaker Chambers]] called the book &quot;sophomoric&quot; and &quot;remarkably silly&quot;. He described the tone of the book as &quot;shrillness without reprieve&quot; and accused Rand of supporting a godless system (which he related to that of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|Soviets]]), claiming &quot;From almost any page of ''Atlas Shrugged'', a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To a gas chamber—go!{{' &quot;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Chambers|first=Whittaker|authorlink=Whittaker Chambers|title=Big Sister is Watching You|magazine=[[National Review]]|pages=594–596|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/222482/big-sister-watching-you/flashback|date=December 8, 1957|accessdate=April 15, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511214136/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/222482/big-sister-watching-you/flashback|archivedate=May 11, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Atlas Shrugged'' received positive reviews from a few publications, including praise from the noted book reviewer [[John Chamberlain (journalist)|John Chamberlain]],&lt;ref name=&quot;asreviews&quot;/&gt; but Rand scholar [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] later wrote that &quot;reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs&quot;, calling it &quot;execrable claptrap&quot; and &quot;a nightmare&quot;—they also said it was &quot;written out of hate&quot; and showed &quot;remorseless hectoring and prolixity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;/&gt;

Rand's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had. The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book, ''[[For the New Intellectual]]'', was similar to that for ''Atlas Shrugged'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein119&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=193–194}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with philosopher [[Sidney Hook]] likening her certainty to &quot;the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sidney|last=Hook|authorlink=Sidney Hook|title=Each Man for Himself|work=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|date=April 9, 1961|page=28|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1961/04/09/archives/each-man-for-himself-for-the-new-intellectual-the-philosophy-of-ayn.html|accessdate=April 15, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511114045/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70914F83B5B147A93CBA9178FD85F458685F9|archivedate=May 11, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author [[Gore Vidal]] calling her viewpoint &quot;nearly perfect in its immorality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gore|last=Vidal|authorlink=Gore Vidal|title=Rocking the Boat|url=https://archive.org/details/rockingboat00vida|url-access=registration|chapter=Two Immoralists: Orville Prescott and Ayn Rand|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|year=1962|oclc=291123|page=[https://archive.org/details/rockingboat00vida/page/234 234]}} Reprinted from ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', July 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein119&quot;/&gt;

In 2005, on the 100th anniversary of Rand's birth, [[Edward Rothstein]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', referred to her fictional writing as quaint [[utopian]] &quot;retro fantasy&quot; and programmatic [[neo-Romanticism]] of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters' &quot;isolated rejection of democratic society&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT100&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/02/books/02rand.html|work=The New York Times|title=Considering the Last Romantic, Ayn Rand, at 100|first=Edward|last=Rothstein|date=February 2, 2005|accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as &quot;romance novels with a patina of [[pseudo-philosophy]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Leslie|last=Clark|title=The philosophical art of looking out number one|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/the-philosophical-art-of-looking-out-number-one-1.835066|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|date=February 17, 2007|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''[[GQ]]''{{'}}s critic columnist Tom Carson described her books as &quot;capitalism's version of middlebrow religious novels&quot; such as ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'' and the ''[[Left Behind]]'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;GQB&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/books/200911/ayn-rand-dick-books-fountainhead?printable=true|title=The Bitch is Back|first=Andrew|last=Corsello|magazine=[[GQ]]|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|date=October 27, 2009|accessdate=April 9, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514133528/http://www.gq.com/entertainment/books/200911/ayn-rand-dick-books-fountainhead?printable=true|archivedate=May 14, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the posthumously published novel [[Ideal (novel)|''Ideal'']], ''[[The New York Times]]'' chief book critic [[Michiko Kakutani]] assessed Rand's &quot;didactic, ideological work&quot; as stylistically having a great deal &quot;in common with the message-minded socialist realism produced in the Soviet Union, which she left in the mid-1920s and vociferously denounced.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/books/review-ayn-rands-ideal-presents-a-protagonist-familiar-in-her-superiority.html|title=Review: Ayn Rand's 'Ideal' Presents a Protagonist Familiar in Her Superiority|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|date=August 10, 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She faced intense opposition from [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] and other contributors for the ''[[National Review]]'' magazine. They published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by [[Whittaker Chambers]], [[Garry Wills]], and [[M. Stanton Evans]].

===Academic reaction===

==== Scholarly reception during Rand's lifetime ====
During Rand's lifetime, her work received little attention from academic scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;reception&quot; /&gt; When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand &quot;a treacherous undertaking&quot; that could lead to &quot;guilt by association&quot; for taking her seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1977|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in ''[[The Personalist]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein115&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was &quot;On the Randian Argument&quot; by libertarian philosopher [[Robert Nozick]], who argued that her [[meta-ethical]] argument is unsound and fails to solve the [[is–ought problem]] posed by [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the Randian Argument|last=Nozick|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Nozick|journal=[[The Personalist]]|date=Spring 1971|volume=52|pages=282–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers, writing in the same publication, argued that Nozick misstated Rand's case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein115&quot; /&gt; Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited. Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2003|pp=373–374, 379–381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Posthumous overall assessments ====
Since Rand's death, interest in her work has gradually increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=114–122}}; {{harvnb|Salmieri|Gotthelf|2005|p=1995}}; {{cite magazine|last=McLemee|first=Scott|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9909/rand.html|title=The Heirs Of Ayn Rand: Has Objectivism Gone Subjective?|magazine=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]|date=September 1999|volume=9|issue=6|pages=45–55|accessdate=April 15, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515004459/http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9909/rand.html|archivedate=May 15, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, historian Jennifer Burns identified &quot;three overlapping waves&quot; of scholarly interest in Rand, including &quot;an explosion of scholarship&quot; since the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=295–296}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of that same year, few universities included Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=116}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the 1998 edition of the ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', political theorist Chandran Kukathas summarizes the mainstream philosophical reception to her work in two parts. Her ethical argument, he says, is viewed by most commentators as an unconvincing variant of Aristotle's ethics. Her political theory, he says, &quot;is of little interest&quot;, marred by an &quot;ill-thought out and unsystematic&quot; effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kukathas&quot;/&gt; Libertarian philosopher [[Michael Huemer]] argues that very few people find Rand's ideas convincing, especially her ethics,&lt;ref name=&quot;whyrand&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Huemer|url=http://www.cato-unbound.org/2010/01/22/michael-huemer/why-ayn-rand-some-alternate-answers|title=Why Ayn Rand? Some Alternate Answers|website=[[Cato Unbound]]|date=January 22, 2010|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he believes are difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael|last=Humer|title=Is Benevolent Egoism Coherent?|journal=[[The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]]|volume=3|issue=2|date=Spring 2002|pages=259–288|url=http://aynrandstudies.com/jars/archives/jars3-2/jars3_2mhuemer.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915095043/http://www.aynrandstudies.com/jars/archives/jars3-2/jars3_2mhuemer.pdf|archivedate=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attributes the attention she receives to her being a &quot;compelling writer&quot;, especially as a novelist, noting that ''Atlas Shrugged'' outsells Rand's non-fiction works as well as the works of other philosophers of [[classical liberalism]] such as [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], or [[Frederic Bastiat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whyrand&quot;/&gt;

Several critics claim that the 1863 novel “[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walicki|Andrews-Rusiecka|1979|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Russian author [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]] is an embodiment of [[rational egoism]] and one of the sources of inspiration for Rand’s thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the book’s main character Lopuhov says “I am not a man to make sacrifices. And indeed there are no such things. One acts in the way that one finds most pleasant.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|2010|pp=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Rand’s particular disdain for the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], philosophers George Walsh&lt;ref name=“Walsh”&gt;{{harvnb|Walsh|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Fred Seddon&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seddon|2003|pp=63–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.

Political scientist [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], while praising Rand's literary accomplishments, criticizes her claim that her only &quot;philosophical debt&quot; was to Aristotle, instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as [[John Locke]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1708/article_detail.asp|publisher=The Claremont Institute|title=Who is Ayn Rand?|first=Charles|last=Murray|year=2010|accessdate=December 7, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604055034/http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1708/article_detail.asp|archivedate=June 4, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rand maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system, philosopher Robert H. Bass argues that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert H.|last=Bass|title=Egoism versus Rights|journal=[[The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]]|volume=7|issue=2|date=Spring 2006|pages=329–349|url=http://aynrandstudies.com/jars/archives/jars7-2/jars7_2rbass1.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105111109/http://www.aynrandstudies.com/jars/archives/jars7-2/jars7_2rbass1.pdf|archivedate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[The Literary Encyclopedia (English)|Literary Encyclopedia]]'' entry for Rand written in 2001, [[John David Lewis]] declared that &quot;Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=3705|title=Ayn Rand|last=Lewis|first=John David|authorlink=John David Lewis|date=October 20, 2001|website=[[The Literary Encyclopedia (English)|The Literary Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rand-specific scholarship ====
Some scholars focus specifically on Rand's work. In 1987 [[Allan Gotthelf]], George Walsh and [[David Kelley]] co-founded the Ayn Rand Society, a group affiliated with the [[American Philosophical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|pp=2, 25}}; {{cite journal|first=William|last=Thomas|title=Ayn Rand Through Two Lenses|journal=Navigator|date=April 2000|volume=3|issue=4|pages=15–19|url=http://www.atlassociety.org/on-ayn-rand-gotthelf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gladstein, [[Harry Binswanger]], [[Allan Gotthelf]], [[John Hospers]], [[Edwin A. Locke]], [[Wallace Matson]], [[Leonard Peikoff]], [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]], and [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]] have taught her work in academic institutions. Sciabarra co-edits the ''[[Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]]'', a nonpartisan [[peer-reviewed journal]] dedicated to the study of Rand's philosophical and literary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 interview in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', Sciabarra commented, &quot;I know they laugh at Rand&quot;, while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharlet|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Sharlet (writer)|journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Ayn-Rand-Has-Finally-Caught/20237/|title=Ayn Rand Has Finally Caught the Attention of Scholars|date=April 9, 1999|volume=45|issue=31|pages=A17–A18|accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[University of Pittsburgh Press]] launched an &quot;Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies&quot; series based on the proceedings of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seddon|first=Fred|s2cid=169272272|title=Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies|journal=Journal of Ayn Rand Studies|volume=14|issue=1|date=July 2014|pages=75–79|doi=10.5325/jaynrandstud.14.1.0075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand's ideas, including ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist'', a volume on Rand's ethical theory published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. Rand's ideas have also been made subjects of study at [[Clemson University|Clemson]] and [[Duke University|Duke]] universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050515/NEWS/505150346/1014|title=Ayn Rand at 100: An 'ism' struts its stuff|first=Benjamin|last=Harvey|work=[[Rutland Herald]]|agency=Columbia News Service|date=May 15, 2005|accessdate=June 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226153815/http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050515%2FNEWS%2F505150346%2F1014|archive-date=December 26, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of English and American literature have largely ignored her work,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2003|p=375}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2003|pp=384–391}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and [[Douglas B. Rasmussen]], while stressing the importance and originality of her thought, describe her style as &quot;literary, hyperbolic and emotional&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1978|p=203}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Political writer and Rand scholar Jack Wheeler writes that despite &quot;the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage&quot;, Rand's ethics are &quot;a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Jack. &quot;Rand and Aristotle&quot;. In {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectivist movement===
{{main|Objectivist movement}}
In 1985, Rand's intellectual heir, Leonard Peikoff, established the [[Ayn Rand Institute]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works. In 1990, after an ideological disagreement with Peikoff, philosopher [[David Kelley]] founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as [[The Atlas Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=280–281}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=19, 114}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The charitable foundation of [[BB&amp;T Corporation]] has also given grants for teaching Rand's ideas or works. The [[University of Texas at Austin]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] are among the schools that have received grants. In some cases, these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=116–117}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=297}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alain Connes''' ({{IPA-fr|alɛ̃ kɔn|lang}}; born 1 April 1947) is a French mathematician, currently Professor at the [[Collège de France]], [[IHÉS]], [[Ohio State University]] and [[Vanderbilt University]]. He was an Invited Professor at the [[Conservatoire national des arts et métiers]] (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Alain Connes, « Géométrie non-commutative », ''Université de tous les savoirs'', '''4''', 175-190, Editions Odile Jacob, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Alain Connes studies [[operator algebra]]s. In his early work on [[von Neumann algebra]]s in the 1970s, he succeeded in obtaining the almost complete classification of injective [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]]s. He also formulated the [[Connes embedding problem]]. Following this, he made contributions in [[K-theory|operator K-theory]] and [[index theory]], which culminated in the [[Baum–Connes conjecture]]. He also introduced [[cyclic homology|cyclic cohomology]] in the early 1980s as a first step in the study of [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative differential geometry]]. He was a member of [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bourbaki: a secret society of mathematicians|first=Maurice|last=Mashaal|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|year=2006|page=18|isbn=978-0-8218-3967-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-CXn6y_1nJ8C&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connes has applied his work in areas of mathematics and [[theoretical physics]], including [[number theory]], [[differential geometry]] and [[particle physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-geometer-of-particle &quot;The Geometer of Particle Physics&quot;] '' Scientific American'', 24 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==

Connes was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1982,&lt;ref name=FieldsMedal00&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Prizes/Fields/1982/index.html#0x82496a1f_0x0005ea30 |title=International mathematical congresses.

He was an [[invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians|invited speaker at the ICM]] in 1974 at Vancouver and in 1986 at Berkeley and a [[plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians|plenary speaker at the ICM]] in 1978 at Helsinki. He is a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and several foreign academies and societies, including the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters|Danish Academy of Sciences]], [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|Norwegian Academy of Sciences]], [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and [[National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]].

'''Allan Dwan''' (born '''Joseph Aloysius Dwan'''; 3 April 1885 – 28 December 1981) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director, producer, and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Born Joseph Aloysius Dwan in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, Dwan, was the younger son of commercial traveler of woolen clothing Joseph Michael Dwan (1857–1917) and his wife Mary Jane Dwan, née Hunt. The family moved to the United States when he was seven years old on 4 December 1892 by ferry from Windsor to Detroit, according to his naturalization petition of August 1939. His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883–1964), became a physician.

Allan Dwan studied engineering at the University of Notre Dame and then worked for a lighting company in Chicago. He had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry, and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Brownlow 1968&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Brownlow, Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Brownlow|title=The Parade's Gone By...|publisher=[[Ballantine Books|Ballantine Books, Inc.]]|location=New York|year=1969|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round, and in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].&lt;ref name=&quot;frankenstein&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Fournier|first=Pierre|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5706057/the-first-frankenstein-of-the-movies|title=The first Frankenstein of the movies|work=[[io9]]|date=4 December 2010|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Dwan operated [[Flying A Studios]] in [[La Mesa, California]] from August 1911 to July 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastcountymagazine.org/node/6833|title=La mesa to honor its tinseltown roots aug. 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lamesa.patch.com/articles/100-simple-melodramas-were-made-in-la-mesa-100-years-ago|title=Proto-Hollywood: 100 Melodramas Were Made In La Mesa 100 Years Ago|date=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On 12 August 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the [[Flying A Studios]] origins in [[La Mesa, California]].

After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed 1922 ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''. Dwan directed [[Gloria Swanson]] in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process [[Phonofilm]]. This short, also featuring [[Thomas Meighan]] and [[Henri de la Falaise]], was produced as a joke, for the 26 April 1925 &quot;Lambs' Gambol&quot; for [[The Lambs]], with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club.

Following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], Dwan directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi (1937 film)|Heidi]]'' (1937) and ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1938).

Dwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors, [[Victor Fleming]], who went on to direct ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'', and [[Marshall Neilan]], who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. He directed his last movie in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/SearchResult.aspx?s=&amp;retailCheck=&amp;Type=PN&amp;CatID=DATABIN_DIRECTOR&amp;ID=11207&amp;AN_ID=&amp;searchedFor=Allan_Dwan_|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=Allan Dwan, Filmography|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Los Angeles at the age of 96, and is interred in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], [[Mission Hills, California]].

Dwan has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6263 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

Daniel Eagan of ''[[Film Journal International]]'' described Dwan as one of the early pioneers of cinema, stating that his style &quot;is so basic as to seem invisible, but he treats his characters with uncommon sympathy and compassion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eagan|first1=Daniel|title=MoMA's Republic Pictures series offers B-movie rediscoveries and restorations|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/momas-republic-pictures-series-offers-b-movie-rediscoveries-and-restorations|website=[[Film Journal International]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media|Prometheus Global Media, LLC]]|accessdate=1 February 2018|date=31 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131223908/http://www.filmjournal.com/momas-republic-pictures-series-offers-b-movie-rediscoveries-and-restorations|archive-date=31 January 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital and most populous city is [[Algiers]], located in the far north of the country on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast. With an area of {{convert|2381741|km2|sqmi|0}}, Algeria is the [[list of countries and dependencies by area|tenth-largest country in the world]], and the largest by area in the [[African Union]] and the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html|title=Country Comparison: Area|publisher=CIA World Factbook|access-date=17 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209041128/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html|archive-date=9 February 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an estimated population of over 44 million, it is the [[List of African countries by population|eighth-most populous country]] in [[Africa]].

Algeria is bordered to [[Algeria–Tunisia border|the northeast]] by [[Tunisia]], to [[Algeria–Libya border|the east]] by [[Libya]], to [[Algeria–Niger border|the southeast]] by [[Niger]], to [[Algeria–Western Sahara border|the southwest]] by [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], and the [[Western Sahara]]n territory, to [[Algeria–Morocco border|the west]] by [[Morocco]], and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea. The country has a semi-arid geography, with most of the population living in the fertile north and the [[Sahara]] dominating the geography of the south. This arid geography makes the country [[Climate change in Algeria|very vulnerable to climate change]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria {{!}} Facts, History, &amp; Geography|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Algeria|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climate change in Algeria|.]]

Pre-1962 Algeria has known many empires and dynasties, including ancient [[Numidia]]ns, [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Punic|Carthaginians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Umayyad]]s, [[Abbasid]]s, [[Idrisid]], [[Aghlabid]], [[Rustamid]], [[Fatimid]]s, [[Zirid]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]], [[Almohads]], [[Zayyanid]]s, [[Spanish Empire|Spaniards]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and finally, the [[French colonial empire]]. Most of the population is [[Arab-Berber]], practicing Islam and using the official languages of Arabic and Berber. However, French serves as an administrative and education language in some contexts, and [[Algerian Arabic]] is the main spoken language.

Algeria has a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential republic]], with local constituencies consisting of 48 provinces and 1,541 communes (counties). Algeria is a [[regional power|regional]] and [[middle power]]. It has the highest [[human development index]] of all non-island African countries and one of the largest economies on the continent, based largely on energy exports. Algeria has the [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|16th largest]] oil reserves in the world and the second largest in Africa, while it has the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|ninth largest reserves]] of [[natural gas]]. [[Sonatrach]], the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa, supplying large amounts of [[natural gas]] to Europe. Algeria has one of the largest militaries in Africa and the largest defence budget. It is a member of the African Union, the [[Arab League]], [[OPEC]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], of which it is a founding member.

The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called [[Iberomaurusian]] (located mainly in the [[Oran]] region). This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the [[Maghreb]] between 15,000 and 10,000 BC.

This life, richly depicted in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period.

From their principal center of power at [[Carthage]], the [[Carthaginians]] expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a [[Phoenicia]]n presence existed at [[Tipasa]], east of [[Cherchell]], [[Hippo Regius]] (modern [[Annaba]]) and [[Rusicade]] (modern [[Skikda]]). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.

As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the [[Mercenary War|Revolt of the Mercenaries]], Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fischer-Bovet2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Christelle Fischer-Bovet|title=Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0sHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91|date= 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00775-8|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spielvogel2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson J.

In 146 BC the city of [[Carthage]] was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern-day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.
[[File:Egypt, Rome, Carthage and Numidia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Numidia]] along with [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt]], [[Roman Republic|Rome]], and [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] 200 BC]]
After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].

For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was the bishop of [[Hippo Regius]] (modern-day Annaba, Algeria), located in the Roman province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. The Germanic [[Vandals]] of [[Geiseric]] moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandaf&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Averil|last2=Ward-Perkins|first2=Bryan|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qf8mrHjfZRoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA124|volume=14|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-32591-2|pages=124–126|chapter=Vandal Africa, 429–533}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not make any significant settlement on the land, as they were harassed by local tribes.

After negligible resistance from the locals, [[Muslims|Muslim]] [[Arabs]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] conquered Algeria in the early 8th century. [[file:Statue of Dyhia in Khenchela (Algeria).jpg|thumb|200px|
[[Dihya]] memorial in [[Khenchela]], Algeria]] Large numbers of the indigenous Berber people converted to Islam. Christians, Berber and Latin speakers remained in the great majority in Tunisia until the end of the 9th century and Muslims only became a vast majority some time in the 10th.&lt;ref name = jonathan&gt;Jonathan Conant, Staying Roman, 2012, pp. 364–365 {{ISBN |978-0-521-19697-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate, numerous local dynasties emerged, including the [[Aghlabids]], [[Almohads]], [[Abdalwadid]], [[Zirids]], [[Rustamids]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]] and the [[Fatimids]]. The Christians left in three waves: after the initial conquest, in the 10th century and the 11th. The last were evacuated to Sicily by the Normans and the few remaining died out in the 14th century.&lt;ref name = jonathan/&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], North Africa was home to many great scholars, saints and sovereigns including [[Judah ibn Kuraish|Judah Ibn Quraysh]], the first grammarian to mention Semitic and Berber languages, the great Sufi masters [[Abu Madyan|Sidi Boumediene (Abu Madyan)]] and [[Sidi El Houari]], and the Emirs [[Abd al-Mu'min|Abd Al Mu'min]] and [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan|Yāghmūrasen]]. It was during this time that the [[Fatimids]] or children of Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, came to the Maghreb. These &quot;Fatimids&quot; went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, Hejaz and the Levant, boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, made up primarily of [[Arabs]] and [[Levant]]ines extending from Algeria to their capital state of [[Cairo]]. The [[Fatimid caliphate]] began to collapse when its governors the [[Zirids]] seceded. In order to punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic [[Taghribat Bani Hilal|Tāghribāt]]. In Al-Tāghrībāt the Amazigh Zirid Hero [[Khalifa al-Zanati|Khālīfā Al-Zānatī]] asks daily, for duels, to defeat the Hilalan hero [[Abu Zayd al-Hilali|Ābu Zayd al-Hilalī]] and many other Arab knights in a string of victories. The [[Zirid]]s, however, were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous [[Berber people|Amazigh]] tribes, however, remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids). The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as [[Fatimid Caliphate]] made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, Tihamah, [[Hejaz]] and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt|title=Fatimid Dynasty (Islamic dynasty)|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101203234/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt|archive-date=1 November 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05 |title=Qantara |publisher=Qantara-med.org |accessdate=13 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009220925/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05 |archive-date=9 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |title=Qantara – Les Almoravides (1056–1147) |publisher=Qantara-med.org |accessdate=13 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921185314/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |archivedate=21 September 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era.

The [[Berber people|Amazighs]] historically consisted of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, [[Sanhadja]], [[Houara]], [[Zenata]], [[Masmuda|Masmouda]], [[Kutama]], Awarba, and [[Berghwata]]). All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR2|title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane| trans-title =History of the Berbers and the Muslim dynasties of northern Africa | language= French |page=XV|author =Khaldūn, Ibn|year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Berber people|Amazigh]] dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands. [[Ibn Khaldun]] provides a table summarising the Amazigh dynasties of the Maghreb region, the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]], [[Banu Ifran]], [[Maghrawa]], [[Almoravid]], [[Hammadid]], [[Almohad]], [[Merinid]], [[Zayyanid dynasty|Abdalwadid]], [[Wattasid]], [[Meknassa]] and [[Hafsid]] dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR115|title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane |trans-title =History of the Berbers and the Muslim dynasties of northern Africa | language= French |pages=X |author =Khaldūn, Ibn|year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Banu Hilal}}
[[File:Empire almohade.PNG|thumb|The Berber [[Almohad Caliphate]] at its greatest extent, c.&amp;nbsp;1212]]

There reigned in [[Ifriqiya]], current Tunisia, a [[Berbers|Berber]] family, [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]], somehow recognising the suzerainty of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliph of [[Cairo]]. Probably in 1048, the Zirid ruler or viceroy, el-Mu'izz, decided to end this suzerainty. The [[Fatimid]] state was too weak to attempt a punitive expedition; The Viceroy, el-Mu'izz, also found another means of revenge.

Between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] were living [[Bedouin]] tribes expelled from [[Arabia]] for their disruption and turbulent influence, both [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] among others, whose presence disrupted farmers in the [[Nile Valley]] since the nomads would often loot. The then [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] vizier devised to relinquish control of the [[Maghreb]] and obtained the agreement of his sovereign. This not only prompted the Bedouins to leave, but the [[Fatimid]] treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance.

Whole tribes set off with women, children, ancestors, animals and camping equipment. Some stopped on the way, especially in [[Cyrenaica]], where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in [[Ifriqiya]] by the [[Gabès Governorate|Gabe]]s region. The [[Zirid]] ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but with each encounter, the last under the walls of [[Kairouan]], his troops were defeated and the Arabs remained masters of the field.

The flood was still rising, and in 1057, the Arabs spread on the high plains of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] where they gradually choked [[Beni Hammad Fort|Qalaa of Banu Hammad]], as they had done in Kairouan a few decades ago. From there they gradually gained the upper [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]] plains. Some were forcibly taken by the [[Almohads]] in the second half of the 12th century. We can say that in the 13th century the Arabs were in all of [[North Africa]], with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions which remained entirely Berber.{{Citation needed|reason=Verification needed for 13th century comment that &quot;Arabs were in all of North Africa&quot; and also verification of events that occurred on and after 1057 A.D. .|date=March 2019}} The influx of [[Bedouin]] tribes was a major factor in the linguistic, cultural [[Arabization]] of the Maghreb and in the spread of [[nomad]]ism in areas where [[agriculture]] had previously been dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://muslimheritage.com/the-great-mosque-of-tlemcen/ |title = The Great Mosque of Tlemcen|website = MuslimHeritage.com|publisher = Foundation for Science Technology and Civilization}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Khaldun]] noted that the lands ravaged by [[Banu Hilal]] tribes had become completely arid desert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm ''Populations Crises and Population Cycles''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527170154/http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm |date=27 May 2013 }}, Claire Russell and W.

In the early 16th century, [[Spain]] constructed fortified outposts ([[presidio]]s) on or near the Algerian coast. [[Spain]] took control of few coastal towns like [[Mers el Kebir]] in 1505; [[Oran]] in 1509; and [[Tlemcen]], [[Mostaganem]] and [[Ténès]] in 1510. In the same year, a few merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbour to Spain, which built a fort on it. The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavour that did not guarantee access for Spain's merchant fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Offensive|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/14.htm|publisher=Country Studies|access-date=4 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014184755/http://countrystudies.us/algeria/14.htm|archive-date=14 October 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman era===
{{main|Ottoman Algeria}}
[[File:Maghreb 15th Century.svg|thumb|The [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Zayyanid kingdom]] of Tlemcen in the fifteenth century and its neighbors]]

The region of Algeria was partially ruled by [[Ottomans]] for three centuries from 1516 to 1830. In 1516 the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the [[Spain|Spaniards]] but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region, forcing the previous ruler, Abu Hamo Musa III of the ''Bani Ziyad'' dynasty, to flee. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Tlemcen]], Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force, Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1792).&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mikaberidze/&gt;

[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]]]

The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;

[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and suffered high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691 and 1740–42.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot; /&gt;

In 1671, the [[taifa]] rebelled, killed the agha, and placed one of its own in power. The new leader received the title of [[Dey]]. After 1689, the right to select the dey passed to the [[divan]], a council of some sixty nobles. It was at first dominated by the ''[[ojaq]]''; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument. In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent, replacing the [[pasha]] in that role, although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;

The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671–1830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of Ottoman government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the [[Kabylie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria&amp;nbsp;– Ottoman Rule|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/16.htm|publisher=Country Studies|access-date=4 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014191245/http://countrystudies.us/algeria/16.htm|archive-date=14 October 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the United States initiating the [[First Barbary War|First]] (1801–1805) and [[Second Barbary War]]s (1815). Following those wars, Algeria was weaker and Europeans, with an Anglo-Dutch fleet commanded by the British [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]], [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|attacked Algiers]]. After a nine-hour bombardment, they obtained a treaty from the Dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by Captain (later Commodore) [[Stephen Decatur]] (U.S. Navy) concerning the demands of tributes. In addition, the Dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving [[Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Littell, Eliakim |title=The Museum of foreign literature, science and art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48L1w21XYI4C&amp;pg=PA231 |year=1836 |publisher=E.

From 1848 until independence, France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and ''département'' of the nation. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[immigrants]], who became known as ''colons'' and later, as ''[[Pied-Noir]]s.'' Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people emigrated to Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randell|first=Keith|title=France: Monarchy, Republic and Empire, 1814–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AvyGHAAACAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|isbn=978-0-340-51805-2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906031725/https://books.google.com/books?id=AvyGHAAACAAJ|archive-date=6 September 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fisher|first1=Michael H.|title=Migration: A World History|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0199764341|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Horne, Alistair |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962 (New York Review Books Classics) |publisher=NYRB Classics |location=1755 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-59017-218-6 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Europeans settled in [[Oran]] and [[Algiers]], and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Habib Hourani, Malise Ruthven (2002). &quot;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=egbOb0mewz4C&amp;pg=PA323 A history of the Arab peoples]''&quot;.

During the late 19th and early 20th century; the European share was almost a fifth of the population. The French government aimed at making Algeria an assimilated part of France, and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900. The indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency, but in contrast to the other colonised countries' path in central Asia and Caucasus, Algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from France. In May 1945, the uprising against the occupying French forces was suppressed through what is now known as the [[Sétif and Guelma massacre]]. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the [[Algerian War]] began. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 [[Harki]]s and their dependents were killed by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]] (FLN) or by [[lynching|lynch]] mobs in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm | work = BBC News | title = French 'Reparation' for Algerians | date = 6 December 2007 | access-date = 16 November 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100420212617/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm | archive-date = 20 April 2010 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FLN used hit and run attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted [[Torture during the Algerian War of Independence|severe reprisals]].

The war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of Algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries. Historians, like [[Alistair Horne]] and [[Raymond Aron]], state that the actual number of Algerian Muslim war dead was far greater than the original FLN and official French estimates but was less than the 1&amp;nbsp;million deaths claimed by the Algerian government after independence.

The war against French rule concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 [[Evian agreements]] and the July 1962 [[Algerian self-determination referendum, 1962|self-determination referendum]]. Some estimates put the Algerian death toll during the French colonial rule at over 10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/frances-colonial-era-crimes-unforgotten-in-algeria/1635943 |title= France's colonial-era crimes 'unforgotten' in Algeria |website= aa.com.tr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Houari Boumediene's Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Houari Boumediene]]]]

Algeria's first president was the Front de Libération Nationale ([[FLN (Algeria)|FLN]]) leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. Morocco's claim to [[Greater Morocco|portions of western Algeria]] led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963. Ben Bella was [[1965 Algerian coup d'état|overthrown in 1965]] by [[Houari Boumédiène]], his former ally and defence minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly socialist and [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]]; Boumédienne continued this trend. But, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He [[collective farming|collectivised]] agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalised. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international [[1973 oil crisis]].

In the 1960s and 1970s under President Houari Boumediene, Algeria pursued a program of industrialization within a state-controlled socialist economy. Boumediene's successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of [[Arabisation]] in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread conventional Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Prochaska|first=David|title=That Was Then, This Is Now: The Battle of Algiers and After.|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|page=141|accessdate=10 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725163300/http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|archive-date=25 July 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS), a broad coalition of Muslim groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

In December 1991 the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] dominated the first of two rounds of [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|legislative elections]]. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a [[High Council of State (Algeria)|High Council of State]] was installed to act as the Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil [[insurgency]] between the Front's armed wing, the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of [[List of massacres during the Algerian Civil War|civilian massacres]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/30/world/98-die-in-one-of-algerian-civil-war-s-worst-massacres.html 98 Die in One of Algerian Civil War's Worst Massacres ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623134112/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/30/world/98-die-in-one-of-algerian-civil-war-s-worst-massacres.html |date=23 June 2017 }}&quot;.

The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

Algeria held [[Algerian presidential election, 1999|elections in 1999]], considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/algeria|title = Freedom in the World 2013: Algeria|publisher = Freedom House|author = Freedom House|access-date = 22 January 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140202094239/http://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/algeria|archive-date = 2 February 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were won by President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]]. He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a &quot;Civil Concord&quot; initiative, approved in a [[Algerian Civil Concord referendum, 1999|referendum]], under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The [[Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat]] (GSPC), a splinter group of the Armed Islamic Group, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

Bouteflika was re-elected in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2004|April 2004 presidential election]] after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]], which was approved in a [[Algerian national reconciliation referendum, 2005|referendum in September 2005]]. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

In November 2008, the [[Algerian Constitution]] was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar [[Arab Spring|protests across the Middle East and North Africa]]. On 24 February 2011, the government lifted Algeria's 19-year-old [[state of emergency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-24/world/algeria.emergency_1_islamist-party-algerian-press-service-emergency-declaration |title=Algeria Officially Lifts State of Emergency |publisher=CNN |date=24 February 2011 |access-date=27 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301134330/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-24/world/algeria.emergency_1_islamist-party-algerian-press-service-emergency-declaration |archive-date=1 March 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaeo&quot; /&gt; In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Profile: Algeria |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/algeria/?profile=all |publisher=Foreign and Commonwealth Office |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213054455/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/algeria/?profile=all |archive-date=13 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, elections are routinely criticized by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Algeria}}
[[File:Algeria relief.png|thumb|The [[Sahara]], the [[Hoggar Mountains|Hoggar]] and the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas mountains]] compose the Algerian relief.]]
Since the 2011 breakup of [[Sudan]], Algeria has been the largest country in Africa, and the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. Its southern part includes a significant portion of the [[Sahara]]. To the north, the [[Tell Atlas]] form with the [[Saharan Atlas]], further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands. Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria. The vast mountain ranges of [[Aures]] and [[Tébessa|Nememcha]] occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border. The highest point is [[Mount Tahat]] ({{convert|3003|m|ft|disp=or}}).

Algeria lies mostly between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19°]] and [[37th parallel north|37°N]] (a small area is north of 37°N and south of 19°N), and longitudes [[9th meridian west|9°W]] and [[12th meridian east|12°E]]. Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural [[harbour]]s. The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a [[steppe]] landscape ending with the [[Saharan Atlas]]; farther south, there is the Sahara desert.&lt;ref name=LOC&gt;{{cite web|last=Metz |first=Helen Chapin |title=Algeria : a country study |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/dztoc.html |publisher=United States Library of Congress |accessdate=18 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115052428/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/dztoc.html |archivedate=15 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hoggar Mountains]] ({{lang-ar|جبال هقار}}), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about {{convert|1500|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the capital, Algiers, and just east of [[Tamanghasset]]. Algiers, [[Oran]], [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], and [[Annaba]] are Algeria's main cities.&lt;ref name=LOC /&gt;

[[File:From tikejda Algeria by ûøkïhçt.jpg|thumb|[[Tikjda]] ski resort in northern Algeria]]
In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.

Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from {{convert|400|to|670|mm|1|abbr=on}} annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as {{convert|1000|mm|1|abbr=on}} in some years.

Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. Algeria also has [[erg (landform)|ergs]], or sand dunes, between mountains. Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can go up to {{convert|110|°F|°C|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

[[File:Nature in algeria 01.jpg|thumb|Algeria varies from coastal areas to mountainous areas and deserts]]
The varied vegetation of Algeria includes [[coastal]], [[mountainous]] and grassy [[desert]]-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife. Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization. The most commonly seen animals include the wild [[boar]]s, [[jackal]]s, and [[gazelle]]s, although it is not uncommon to spot [[fennecs]] (foxes), and [[jerboas]]. Algeria also has a small [[African leopard]] and [[Saharan cheetah]] population, but these are seldom seen. A species of deer, the [[Barbary stag]], inhabits the dense humid forests in the north-eastern areas.

A variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers. The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals. [[Barbary macaque]]s are the sole native monkey. Snakes, [[monitor lizard]]s, and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of [[rodent]]s throughout the [[semi arid]] regions of Algeria. Many animals are now extinct, including the [[Barbary lion]]s, [[Atlas bear]]s and [[West African crocodile|crocodile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0014734 Crocodiles in the Sahara Desert: An Update of Distribution, Habitats and Population Status for Conservation Planning in Mauritania] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810113430/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0014734 |date=10 August 2018 }}&quot;.

In the north, some of the native flora includes [[Macchia]] scrub, [[Olive|olive trees]], [[oak]]s, [[cedrus|cedars]] and other [[Pinophyta|conifers]]. The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens ([[Aleppo pine]], [[juniper]], and [[evergreen oak]]) and some deciduous trees. [[Ficus|Fig]], [[eucalyptus]], [[agave]], and various [[Arecaceae|palm trees]] grow in the warmer areas. The [[grape vine]] is indigenous to the coast. In the Sahara region, some oases have palm trees. [[Acacia]]s with wild [[olive]]s are the predominant flora in the remainder of the [[Sahara]].

[[Camel]]s are used extensively; the desert also abounds with venomous and nonvenomous snakes, [[scorpion]]s, and numerous insects.

Elected politicians have relatively little sway over Algeria. Instead, a group of unelected civilian and military &quot;décideurs&quot; (&quot;deciders&quot;), known as &quot;le pouvoir&quot; (&quot;the power&quot;), actually rule the country, even deciding who should be president. The most powerful man may be [[Mohamed Mediène]], the head of military intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Still waiting for real democracy|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21554565|newspaper=The Economist|date=12 May 2012|access-date=16 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103155414/http://www.economist.com/node/21554565|archive-date=3 January 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, many of these generals have died or retired.

The head of state is the [[President of Algeria]], who is elected for a five-year term. The president was formerly limited to two five-year terms, but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on 11 November 2008 removed this limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7724635.stm |title= Algeria Deputies Scrap Term Limit |work=BBC News |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=24 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081114015503/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7724635.stm| archivedate= 14 November 2008 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2019 Algerian presidential election|next presidential election]] was planned to be in April 2019, but [[2019 Algerian protests|widespread protests]] erupted on 22 February against the president's decision to participate in the election, which resulted in President Bouteflika announcing his resignation on 3 April.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/02/algeria-latest-news-president-abdelaziz-bouteflika-resigns Algeria's president Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigns after 20 years]&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria has universal [[suffrage]] at 18 years of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; The President is the head of the [[Algerian Army|army]], the [[Council of Ministers of Algeria|Council of Ministers]] and the [[High Security Council]].

Algeria is included in the European Union's [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.
Giving incentives and rewarding best performers, as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner, are the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) that came into force in 2014. It has a budget of €15.4 billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes.

In 2009, the French government agreed to compensate victims of nuclear tests in Algeria. Defense Minister Herve Morin stated that &quot;It's time for our country to be at peace with itself, at peace thanks to a system of compensation and reparations,&quot; when presenting the draft law on the payouts. Algerian officials and activists believe that this is a good first step and hope that this move would encourage broader reparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-offers-compensation-to-victims-sickened-by-nuclear-tests-1.797730|title=France offers compensation to victims sickened by nuclear tests|access-date=3 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104142121/http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-offers-compensation-to-victims-sickened-by-nuclear-tests-1.797730|archive-date=4 November 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria has been categorized by [[Freedom House]] as &quot;not free&quot; since it began publishing such ratings in 1972, with the exception of 1989, 1990, and 1991, when the country was labeled &quot;partly free.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world|work=Freedom House|accessdate=19 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127202423/http://www.freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world|archive-date=27 January 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, the ''Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor'' issued a report regarding violation of [[media freedom]] in Algeria. It clarified that the Algerian government imposed restriction on [[freedom of the press]]; expression; and right to peaceful demonstration, protest and assembly as well as intensified censorship of the [[Broadcast media|media]] and websites. Due to the fact that the journalists and activists criticize the ruling government, some media organizations' licenses are canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1629/Algeria-must-stop-crushing-dissent-by-imprisoning-journalists-and-activists|title=Algeria must stop crushing dissent by imprisoning journalists and activists|last=Monitor|first=Euro-Med|newspaper=Euro-Mediterranean|language=en|date=December 2016|access-date=21 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202064732/http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1629/Algeria-must-stop-crushing-dissent-by-imprisoning-journalists-and-activists|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Provinces of Algeria|Districts of Algeria|Municipalities of Algeria}}
Algeria is divided into 48 [[provinces of Algeria|provinces]] (''[[wilaya]]s''), 553 [[districts of Algeria|districts]] (''[[daïra]]s'') and 1,541 [[Municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]] (''[[baladiyah]]s''). Each province, district, and municipality is named after its [[Capital city|seat]], which is usually the largest city.

The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence. When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order. With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==

Algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/CLASS.XLS |title=World Bank list of economies |date=January 2011 |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=27 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522153925/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/CLASS.XLS |archive-date=22 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria's currency is the [[Algerian dinar|dinar]] (DZD). The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the country's socialist post-independence development model. In recent years, the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; These restrictions are just starting to be lifted off recently although questions about Algeria's slowly-diversifying economy remain.

Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy. The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; The country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political, economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases. Public spending has increased by 27% annually during the past 5 years. The 2010–14 public-investment programme will cost US$286 billion, 40% of which will go to human development.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

[[File:Theatre d'oran.jpg|thumb|left|The port city of Oran]]

The Algerian economy grew by 2.6% in 2011, driven by public spending, in particular in the construction and public-works sector, and by growing internal demand. If hydrocarbons are excluded, growth has been estimated at 4.8%. Growth of 3% is expected in 2012, rising to 4.2% in 2013. The rate of inflation was 4% and the budget deficit 3% of GDP. The current-account surplus is estimated at 9.3% of GDP and at the end of December 2011, official reserves were put at US$182 billion.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt; Inflation, the lowest in the region, has remained stable at 4% on average between 2003 and 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;MFW4A&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfw4a.org/algeria/algeria-financial-sector-profile.html |title=Algeria: Financial Sector Profile |publisher=Making Finance Work for Africa |accessdate=17 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725141517/http://www.mfw4a.org/algeria/algeria-financial-sector-profile.html |archive-date=25 July 2013 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Algeria announced a budgetary surplus of $26.9 billion, 62% increase in comparison to 2010 surplus.

Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $173 billion in [[foreign currency reserves]] and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund. In addition, Algeria's [[List of countries by external debt|external debt]] is extremely low at about 2% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; The economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth, and, despite high foreign exchange reserves (US$178 billion, equivalent to three years of imports), current expenditure growth makes Algeria's budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues.&lt;ref name=imfart4/&gt;

In 2011, the agricultural sector and services recorded growth of 10% and 5.3%, respectively.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt; About 14% of the labor force are employed in the [[Agriculture in Algeria|agricultural sector]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt; Fiscal policy in 2011 remained expansionist and made it possible to maintain the pace of public investment and to contain the strong demand for jobs and housing.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

===Oil and Natural Resources===

[[File:Algeria pipelines map.jpg|thumb|left|Pipelines across Algeria]]

Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an [[OPEC]] member since 1969. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe.&lt;ref name=opb15&gt;{{cite web|title=OPEC Bulletin 8-9/12|url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/flipbook/OB08092012/OB08092012/assets/basic-html/page17.html|page=15|access-date=6 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224114739/http://www.opec.org/opec_web/flipbook/OB08092012/OB08092012/assets/basic-html/page17.html|archive-date=24 December 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|10th-largest reserves of natural gas]] in the world and is the [[List of countries by natural gas exports|sixth-largest gas exporter]]. The U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] reported that in 2005, Algeria had {{convert|160|Tcuft|order=flip}} of proven [[natural gas reserves|natural-gas reserves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ciawfb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2253rank.html|title=Country Comparison: Natural Gas – Proved Reserves|publisher=Cia.gov|accessdate=17 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307234405/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2253rank.html|archive-date=7 March 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also ranks [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|16th in oil reserves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AlgeriaFactbook&quot;/&gt;

Non-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%. To cope with social demands, the authorities raised expenditure, especially on basic food support, employment creation, support for SMEs, and higher salaries. High hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position.&lt;ref name=imfart4/&gt;

Income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices, though the trend in production volume is downwards.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt; Production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume, continues to decline, dropping from 43.2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011. Nevertheless, the sector accounted for 98% of the total volume of exports in 2011, against 48% in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsa-algerie.com/actualite/item/622-le-temps-des-crapules |title=Le temps des crapules&amp;nbsp;– Tout sur l'Algérie |publisher=Tsa-algerie.com |date=27 May 2013 |author =Benchicou, Mohamed |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311022328/http://www.tsa-algerie.com/actualite/item/622-le-temps-des-crapules |archivedate=11 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 70% of budgetary receipts, or US$71.4 billion.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

The Algerian national oil company is [[Sonatrach]], which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in Algeria.

This means they use just under 4.5 times as much biocapacity as Algeria contains. As a result, Algeria is running a biocapacity deficit.&lt;ref name=footprintdata/&gt;

===Research and alternative energy sources===
Algeria has invested an estimated 100 billion dinars towards developing research facilities and paying researchers. This development program is meant to advance alternative energy production, especially solar and wind power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?article1571 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 October 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101101749/http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?article1571 |archivedate=1 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria is estimated to have the largest solar energy potential in the Mediterranean, so the government has funded the creation of a solar science park in Hassi R'Mel. Currently, Algeria has 20,000 research professors at various universities and over 780 research labs, with state-set goals to expand to 1,000. Besides solar energy, areas of research in Algeria include space and satellite telecommunications, nuclear power and medical research.

===Labour market===
Despite a decline in total [[unemployment]], youth and women unemployment is high.&lt;ref name=imfart4&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria: 2011 Article IV Consultation|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr1220.pdf|publisher=IMF|access-date=6 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311020241/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr1220.pdf|archive-date=11 March 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment particularly affects the young, with a jobless rate of 21.5% among the 15–24 age group.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

[[File:Giants - Rock towers in the Algerian Sahara.jpg|thumb|[[Djanet]]]]

The development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities, but since 2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built.

There are several [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] in Algeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/dz|accessdate=25 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919064425/https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/dz|archive-date=19 September 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad]], the first capital of the [[Hammadid]] empire; [[Tipasa]], a Phoenician and later Roman town; and [[Djémila]] and [[Timgad]], both [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins; [[M'Zab Valley]], a limestone valley containing a large urbanized [[oasis]]; and the [[Casbah]] of Algiers, an important citadel. The only natural [[World Heritage Site]] is the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]], a mountain range.

===Transport===

[[File:Autoroute est ouest ghomri2.JPG|thumb|The main highway connecting the Moroccan to the Tunisian border was a part of the [[Cairo–Dakar Highway]] project]]

The Algerian road network is the densest in Africa; its length is estimated at {{cvt|180,000|km}} of highways, with more than 3,756 structures and a paving rate of 85%. This network will be complemented by the [[Algeria East–West Highway|East-West Highway]], a major infrastructure project currently under construction. It is a 3-way, {{convert|1216|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} highway, linking [[Annaba]] in the extreme east to the [[Tlemcen]] in the far west. Algeria is also crossed by the [[Trans-Sahara Highway]], which is now completely paved. This road is supported by the Algerian government to increase trade between the six countries crossed: Algeria, [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Chad]], and [[Tunisia]].

Algerian painters, like [[:fr:Mohamed Racim|Mohamed Racim]] or Baya, attempted to revive the prestigious Algerian past prior to French colonization, at the same time that they have contributed to the preservation of the authentic values of Algeria. In this line, [[Mohamed Temam]], [[Abdelkhader Houamel]] have also returned through this art, scenes from the history of the country, the habits and customs of the past and the country life. Other new artistic currents including the one of [[M'hamed Issiakhem]], [[Mohammed Khadda]] and [[Bachir Yelles]], appeared on the scene of Algerian painting, abandoning figurative classical painting to find new pictorial ways, in order to adapt Algerian paintings to the new realities of the country through its struggle and its aspirations.

Today Algeria contains, in its literary landscape, big names having not only marked the Algerian literature, but also the universal literary heritage in Arabic and French.

As a first step, Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity, there is the publication of novels as the ''Algerian trilogy'' of [[Mohammed Dib]], or even ''Nedjma'' of [[Kateb Yacine]] novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work. Other known writers will contribute to the emergence of Algerian literature whom include [[Mouloud Feraoun]], [[Malek Bennabi]], [[Malek Haddad]], [[Moufdi Zakaria]], Abdelhamid Ben Badis, Mohamed Laïd Al-Khalifa, [[Mouloud Mammeri]], [[Frantz Fanon]], and [[Assia Djebar]].

Currently, a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression, due to the terrorism that occurred during the 1990s, the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure. Among the most noted recent works, there is the writer, ''the swallows of Kabul'' and ''the attack'' of [[Yasmina Khadra]], ''the oath of barbarians'' of [[Boualem Sansal]], ''memory of the flesh'' of [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] and the last novel by Assia Djebar ''nowhere in my father's House''.

The Algerian state's interest in film-industry activities can be seen in the annual budget of DZD 200 million (EUR 1.8) allocated to production, specific measures and an ambitious programme plan implemented by the Ministry of Culture in order to promote national production, renovate the cinema stock and remedy the weak links in distribution and exploitation.

The financial support provided by the state, through the Fund for the Development of the Arts, Techniques and the Film Industry (FDATIC) and the Algerian Agency for Cultural Influence (AARC), plays a key role in the promotion of national production. Between 2007 and 2013, FDATIC subsidised 98 films (feature films, documentaries and short films). In mid-2013, AARC had already supported a total of 78 films, including 42 feature films, 6 short films and 30 documentaries.

According to the European Audiovisual Observatory's LUMIERE database, 41 Algerian films were distributed in Europe between 1996 and 2013; 21 films in this repertoire were Algerian-French co-productions.

==Health==
{{Main|Health in Algeria}}
In 2002, Algeria had inadequate numbers of physicians (1.13 per 1,000 people), nurses (2.23 per 1,000 people), and dentists (0.31 per 1,000 people). Access to &quot;improved water sources&quot; was limited to 92% of the population in urban areas and 80% of the population in the rural areas. Some 99% of Algerians living in urban areas, but only 82% of those living in rural areas, had access to &quot;improved sanitation&quot;. According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of &quot;reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015&quot;. Given Algeria's young population, policy favors preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunization program. However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]]. The poor generally receive health care free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf |title=Library of Congress Country Studies – Algeria |access-date=20 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319155750/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf |archive-date=19 March 2009 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, in a centralized system that was designed to significantly reduce the rate of illiteracy, the Algerian government introduced a decree by which school attendance became compulsory for all children aged between 6 and 15 years who have the ability to track their learning through the 20 facilities built since independence, now the literacy rate is around 78.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;illit&quot;/&gt;

Since 1972, Arabic is used as the language of instruction during the first nine years of schooling. From the third year, French is taught and it is also the language of instruction for science classes. The students can also learn English, Italian, Spanish and German. In 2008, new programs at the elementary appeared, therefore the compulsory schooling does not start at the age of six anymore, but at the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presse-dz.com/revue-de-presse/version-imprimable/1045-les-verites-de-benbouzid.html |title=Ecoles privées, Tamazight, enseignement du Français, syndicats&amp;nbsp;... – Les vérités de Benbouzid |publisher=Presse-dz.com |accessdate=18 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115130310/http://www.presse-dz.com/revue-de-presse/version-imprimable/1045-les-verites-de-benbouzid.html |archive-date=15 November 2012 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apart from the 122 private schools, the Universities of the State are free of charge. After nine years of primary school, students can go to the high school or to an educational institution. The school offers two programs: general or technical. At the end of the third year of secondary school, students pass the exam of the baccalaureate, which allows once it is successful to pursue graduate studies in universities and institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.algerie-dz.com/article10808.html |title=Le taux d'analphabétisme en Algérie est de 21,3% |publisher=Algerie-dz.com |accessdate=18 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021070732/http://www.algerie-dz.com/article10808.html |archive-date=21 October 2012 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is officially compulsory for children between the ages of six and 15. In 2008, the illiteracy rate for people over 10 was 22.3%, 15.6% for men and 29.0% for women. The province with the lowest rate of illiteracy was [[Algiers Province]] at 11.6%, while the province with the highest rate was [[Djelfa Province]] at 35.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;illit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Taux d'Analphabétisme et taux d'Alphabétisation de la population âgée de 10 ans et plus selon le sexe et la wilaya de résidence|url=http://www.ons.dz/IMG/pdf/pop9_national.pdf|publisher=Office National des Statistiques|access-date=7 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204094417/http://www.ons.dz/IMG/pdf/pop9_national.pdf|archive-date=4 February 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria has 26 universities and 67 institutions of higher education, which must accommodate a million Algerians and 80,000 foreign students in 2008. The [[University of Algiers]], founded in 1879, is the oldest, it offers education in various disciplines (law, medicine, science and letters). 25 of these universities and almost all of the institutions of higher education were founded after the independence of the country.

Even if some of them offer instruction in [[Arabic]] like areas of law and the economy, most of the other sectors as science and medicine continue to be provided in French and English. Among the most important universities, there are the [[University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene]], the [[University of Mentouri]] Constantine, and [[University of Oran]] Es-Senia. The [[University of Abou Bekr Belkaïd]] in Tlemcen and [[University of Batna]] Hadj Lakhdar occupy the 26th and 45th row in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webometrics.info/en/Africa/Algeria |title=Algeria &amp;#124; Ranking Web of Universities |publisher=Webometrics.info |accessdate=18 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208084507/http://webometrics.info/en/Africa/Algeria |archivedate=8 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of characters in [[Ayn Rand]]'s 1957 novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]].''

==Major characters==
The following are major characters from the novel.{{refn|group=note|Characters in this article are listed as &quot;major&quot; if they meet one of the following criteria:
*they are listed as &quot;major&quot; characters in a widely available study guide, such as [[CliffsNotes]], [[SparkNotes]], or [[Gale (Cengage)|Gale's]] ''Novels for Students'';
*they are listed as &quot;primary heroic&quot; or &quot;arch-villain&quot; characters in Gladstein's ''The New Ayn Rand Companion'';
*they are the focus of an essay in a scholarly book about the novel, such as ''Essays on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged'' or ''Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged''.}}

===Protagonists===

====Dagny Taggart====
Dagny Taggart is the [[protagonist]] of the novel. She is Vice-President in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, under her brother, James Taggart. Given James' incompetence, Dagny is responsible for all the workings of the railroad.

====Francisco d'Anconia====
Francisco d'Anconia is one of the central characters in ''Atlas Shrugged'', an owner by inheritance of the world's largest [[copper]] mining operation. He is a childhood friend, and the first love, of Dagny Taggart. A child prodigy of exceptional talents, Francisco was dubbed the &quot;climax&quot; of the d'Anconia line, an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists. He was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. He began working while still in school, proving that he could have made a fortune without the aid of his family's wealth and power. Later, Francisco bankrupts the d'Anconia business to put it out of others' reach. His full name is given as &quot;Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastián d'Anconia&quot;.{{refn|group=note|The accent in the given name ''Sebastián'' is in accordance with [[Spanish orthography]]; however, the same rule would require writing ''Andrés''.}}

====John Galt====
{{Main|John Galt}}
John Galt is the primary male hero of ''Atlas Shrugged''. He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental, who often dines with Eddie Willers in the employees' cafeteria, and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental. Only Eddie's side of their conversations is given in the novel. Later in the novel, the reader discovers this worker's true identity.

Before working for Taggart Transcontinental, Galt worked as an engineer for the Twentieth Century Motor Company, where he secretly invented a generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity, but abandoned his prototype, and his employment, when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment. This prototype was found by Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden. Galt himself remains concealed throughout much of the novel, working a job and living by himself, where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership. Much of the book's third division is given to his broadcast speech, which presents the author's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].

====Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Rearden====
Henry (known as &quot;Hank&quot;) Rearden is one of the central characters in ''Atlas Shrugged''. He owns the most important steel company in the United States, and invents Rearden Metal, an [[alloy]] stronger, lighter, cheaper and tougher than steel. He lives in [[Philadelphia]] with his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and his elderly mother. Rearden represents a type of [[self-made man]] and eventually divorces Lillian, abandons his steel mills following a bloody assault by government-planted workers, and joins John Galt's strike.

====Eddie Willers====
Edwin &quot;Eddie&quot; Willers is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and himself likewise. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. Willers does not possess the creative ability of Galt's associates, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. After Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt, Willers maintains the railroad until its collapse.

====Ragnar Danneskjöld====
One of Galt's first followers, and world-famous as a [[pirate]], who seizes relief ships sent from the United States to the People's States of Europe. He works to  ensure that once those espousing Galt's philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they have enough capital to rebuild the world. Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation, and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years. Danneskjöld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a retired [[film star]]. Considered a misfit by Galt's other adherents, he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding Galt's perspective.

According to [[Barbara Branden]], who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing Danneskjöld's adventures at sea, cut from the final published text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reedstrom&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reedstrom |first1=Karen |title=Barbara Branden |journal=Full Context |date=September–October 1998 |page=4 |url=http://barbarabranden.com/interview4.html |accessdate=14 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1974 comment at a lecture, Ayn Rand admitted that Danneskjöld's name was a tribute to Victor Hugo's novel, {{ill|Hans of Iceland|fr|Han d'Islande|lt=''Hans of Iceland''}}, wherein the hero becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld. In the published book, Danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.

===Antagonists===

====James Taggart====
The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book's most important antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of making operational decisions on his own. He relies on his sister, Dagny Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti-capitalist moral and political beliefs. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.

====Lillian Rearden====
The unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden, who dislikes his habits and (secretly at first) seeks to ruin Rearden to prove her own value. Lillian achieves this, when she passes information to James Taggart about her husband's affair with his sister. This information is used to persuade Rearden to sign a Gift Certificate which delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to others. Lillian thereafter uses James Taggart for sexual satisfaction, until Hank abandons her.

====Dr. Floyd Ferris====

Ferris is a biologist who works as &quot;co-ordinator&quot; at the State Science Institute. He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled ''Why Do You Think You Think?'' He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal. He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan. Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon, and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader, a torture machine. When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt. Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.

====Dr. Robert Stadler====
A former professor at Patrick Henry University, and along with colleague Hugh Akston, mentor to Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including a sound-based weapon known as Project X (Xylophone). He is killed when Cuffy Meigs (see below) drunkenly overloads the circuits of Project X, causing it to destroy itself and every structure and living thing in a 100-mile radius. The character was, in part, modeled on [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of [[nuclear weapon]]s.`&lt;ref name=&quot;Harriman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rand |first1=Ayn |last2=Peikoff |first2=Leonard |editor1-last=Harriman |editor1-first=David |title=The Journals of Ayn Rand |date=1999 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-1-101-13721-5 |pages=330-331 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Journals_of_Ayn_Rand/2Gkx0STfl5kC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0 |accessdate=14 April 2020 |ref=harv |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the &quot;man who knew better&quot; but chose not to act for the good.

====Wesley Mouch====
The incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty. In return for betraying Hank by helping broker the Equalization of Opportunity Bill (which, by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one, forces Hank to divest most of his companies), he is given a senior position at the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources. Later in the novel he becomes its Top Co-ordinator, a position that eventually becomes Economic Dictator of the country.

==Secondary characters==
The following secondary characters also appear in the novel.{{refn|group=note|Secondary characters are listed if they appear in character lists from any of the works used to establish the list of major characters above, but do not meet the criteria for &quot;major.&quot; Minor characters who are not listed in secondary works are not listed here.}}

*'''Hugh Akston''' is identified as &quot;One of the last great advocates of reason.&quot; He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University, where he taught Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt, and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He was, along with Robert Stadler, a father figure to these three. Akston's name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. He now works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful at the job. When Dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental. He is based on [[Aristotle]].
*'''Jeff Allen''' is a tramp who stows away on a Taggart train during one of Dagny's cross-country trips. Instead of throwing him out, she allows him to ride as her guest. It is from Allen that she learns the full story behind the collapse of the Twentieth Century Motor Company (Rand's extensive metaphor for the inherent flaws of communism), as well as a hint of John Galt's true background.
*'''Calvin Atwood''' is owner of Atwood Light and Power Company and joins Galt's strike.
*'''Mayor Bascom''' is the mayor of Rome, Wisconsin, who reveals part of the history of the Twentieth Century Motor Company.
*'''Dr. Blodgett''' is the scientist who pulls the lever to demonstrate Project X.
*'''Orren Boyle''' is the head of Associated Steel, antithesis of Hank Rearden and a friend of James Taggart. He is an investor in the San Sebastián Mines. He disappears from the story after having a nervous breakdown following the failed 'unification' of the steel industry.
*'''Laura Bradford''' is an actress and Kip Chalmers' mistress. She is one of the passengers on his train, and dies in the Taggart Tunnel disaster.
*'''Bill Brent''' is the chief dispatcher for the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental, who tries to prevent the Taggart Tunnel disaster.
*'''Cherryl Brooks''' is a dime store shopgirl who marries James Taggart after a chance encounter in her store the night the John Galt Line was falsely deemed his greatest success. She marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. Cherryl is at first harsh towards Dagny, having believed Jim Taggart's descriptions of his sister, until she questions employees of the railroad. Upon learning that her scorn had been misdirected, Cherryl puts off apologizing to Dagny out of shame, but eventually admits to Dagny that when she married Jim, she thought he had the heroic qualities that she had looked up to - she thought she was marrying someone like Dagny. Shortly after making this admission, she commits suicide by jumping over a street guardrail to her death, unable to live with her worthless husband and seeing no way to escape him.
*'''Millie Bush''' was &quot;a mean, ugly little eight-year-old&quot; girl voted to receive gold braces to straighten her teeth by the Marxist &quot;family&quot; committee who determined how pay was allocated at The Twentieth Century Motor Company. Her teeth are later knocked out by a man denied an allowance by the committee to purchase the things he valued.
*'''Emma Chalmers''', Kip Chalmers' mother, gains some influence after his death. Known as &quot;Kip's Ma,&quot; she starts a soybean-growing project in Louisiana and commandeers thousands of railroad freight cars to move the harvest. As a result, the year's wheat crop from Minnesota never reaches the rest of the country, but instead rots in storage; also, the soybean crop is lost, having been reaped too early.
*'''Kip Chalmers''' is a Washington man who has decided to run for election as Legislator from California. On the way to a campaign rally, the Taggart Transcontinental train that is carrying him encounters a split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine. His demands lead to a coal-burning steam engine being attached to his train in its stead and used to pull it through an eight-mile tunnel. The result is the suffocation of all passengers and the destruction of the Taggart Tunnel.
*'''Dan Conway''' is the middle-aged president of the Phoenix-Durango railroad. Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows. When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is used to drive his business out of [[Colorado]], he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing.
*'''Ken Danagger''' owns Danagger Coal in Pennsylvania. He helps Hank Rearden illegally make Rearden Metal, then later decides to quit and join Galt's strike moments before Dagny arrives to try to persuade him otherwise.
*'''Quentin Daniels''' is an enterprising engineer hired by Dagny Taggart to reconstruct John Galt's motor. Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had. Dagny's pursuit of Quentin leads her to Galt's Gulch.
*'''Sebastian d'Anconia''' was the 16th (or 17th) Century founder of the d'Anconia dynasty. Escaped from Spain because of expressing his opinions too freely and coming in conflict with the [[Inquisition]], leaving behind a palace and his beloved. Started a small mine in South America, which became the beginning of a mining empire and a new fortune (and a new palace). Eventually sent for his beloved who had waited for him many years. He is the role model which Francisco d'Anconia looks to, as Dagny Taggart looks to Nathaniel Taggart. Francisco remarks that their respective ancestors would have liked each other.
*'''Balph Eubank''' is called &quot;the literary leader of the age&quot;, despite the fact that no book he has written has sold more than 3,000 copies. He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to 10,000 copies. He is a [[misogynist]] who thinks it disgusting that Dagny Taggart is a railroad vice-president.
*The '''Fishwife''' is one of the strikers, who earns her living by providing the fish for Hammond's grocery market; she is described as having &quot;dark, disheveled hair and large eyes&quot;, and is a writer. Galt says she &quot;wouldn't be published outside. She believes that when one deals with words, one deals with the mind.&quot; According to Barbara Branden in her book ''[[The Passion of Ayn Rand]]'', &quot;The [[Fishwife]] is Ayn's [[List of Hitchcock cameo appearances|Hitchcock-like]] appearance in ''Atlas Shrugged''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Branden1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Branden|title=The passion of Ayn Rand|url=https://archive.org/details/passionofaynrand00branrich|url-access=registration|accessdate=24 October 2010|date=20 May 1986|publisher=Doubleday|page=[https://archive.org/details/passionofaynrand00branrich/page/229 229]}}&lt;/ref&gt; So says too Leonard Peikoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast

*'''Lawrence Hammond''' runs Hammond Cars in Colorado, one of the few companies in existence that still produces top-quality vehicles. He eventually quits and joins the strike.
*'''Richard Halley''' is Dagny Taggart's favorite composer, who mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph. Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. At age 24, his opera ''[[Phaethon]]'' was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. After 19 years, ''Phaethon'' was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared. It is later revealed that he has joined the strike and settled in Galt's Gulch.
*'''Mrs. William Hastings''' is the widow of the chief engineer at the Twentieth Century Motor Company. Her husband quit shortly after Galt did and joined the strike some years later. Her lead allows Dagny to find Hugh Akston.
*'''Dr. Thomas Hendricks''' is a famous brain surgeon who developed a new method of preventing strokes. He joined Galt's strike when the American medical system was put under government control.
*'''Tinky Holloway''' is one of the &quot;looters&quot; and is frequently referred to and quoted by other characters in the story, but he has only one major appearance: during the Washington meeting with Hank Rearden.
*'''Lee Hunsacker''' is in charge of a company called Amalgamated Service when takes over the Twentieth Century Motor Company. He files a lawsuit that eventually leads to Midas Mulligan and Judge Narragansett joining the strike. A failed businessman, he laments constantly that no-one ever gave him a chance.
*'''Gwen Ives''' is Hank Rearden's secretary, described as being in her late twenties and remaining calm and professional despite the chaos that threatens his business. When Rearden abandons his mills and joins Galt's strike, she and many other employees do the same.
*'''Gilbert Keith-Worthing''' is a British novelist of erstwhile fame, now neglected but still considered a &quot;walking classic,&quot; and a proponent of the idea that freedom is an illusion. Kip Chalmers brings him along on the train to California, &quot;for no reason that either of them could discover&quot;; he dies in the Taggart Tunnel disaster.
*'''Owen Kellogg''' is Assistant to the Manager of the Taggart Terminal in New York. He catches Dagny Taggart's eye as one of the few competent men on staff. After seeing the sorry state of the Ohio Division, she decides to make him its new Superintendent. However, as soon as she returns to New York, Kellogg informs her that he is quitting his job. Owen Kellogg eventually reaches, and settles in, Galt's Gulch.
*'''Fred Kinnan''' is a labor leader and member of the looter cabal. Unlike the others, however, Kinnan is straightforward and honest about his purpose. Kinnan is the only one to openly state the true motivations of himself and his fellow conspirators. At the end of Galt's three-hour speech, he expresses admiration for the man, as he says what he means. Despite this, Kinnan admits that he is one of the people Galt is out to destroy.
*'''Paul Larkin''' is an unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family. He meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down. James Taggart knows he is friends with Hank Rearden and challenges his loyalty, and Larkin assures Taggart that he will go along with them.
*'''Eugene Lawson''' heads the Community Bank of Madison, then gets a job with the government when it his bank goes bankrupt. One of the looter's cabal, he is a collectivist who abhors production and money-making.
*'''Mort Liddy''' is a [[hack writer|hack]] composer who writes trite scores for movies and modern symphonies to which no one listens. He believes melody is a primitive vulgarity. He is one of Lillian Rearden's friends and a member of the cultural elite.
*'''Clifton Locey''' is a friend of Jim Taggart who takes the position of vice-president of operation when Dagny Taggart quits.
*'''Pat Logan''' is the engineer on the first run of the John Galt Line. He later strikes.
*'''Kay Ludlow''' is a beautiful actress who quit Holywood because of the roles she was given and married secretly the pirate Ragnar Danneskjöld.
*'''Dick McNamara''' is a contractor who finished the San Sebastian Line. Dagny Taggart plans to hire him to lay the new Rearden Metal track for the Rio Norte Line, but before she does so, he mysteriously disappears. She later discovers that he has joined the strike and settled in Galt's Gulch.
*'''Cuffy Meigs''' is the Director of Unification for the railroad business. He carries a pistol and a lucky rabbit's foot, and he dresses in a military uniform, and has been described as &quot;impervious to thought&quot;. Meigs seizes control of Project X and accidentally destroys it, demolishing the country's last railroad bridge across the Mississippi River and killing himself, his men, and Dr. Stadler.
*'''Dave Mitchum''' is a state-hired superintendent of the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental. He is partially responsible for the Taggart Tunnel disaster.
*'''Chick Morrison''' holds the position of &quot;Morale Conditioner&quot; in the government. He quits when society begins to collapse and flees to a stronghold in Tennessee. His fellow looters consider it unlikely that he will survive.
*'''Horace Bussby Mowen''' is the president of the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc. of Connecticut. He is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society. Dagny Taggart hires Mowen to produce switches made of Rearden Metal. He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be cajoled into accepting the contract. When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative source.
*'''Midas Mulligan''' is a wealthy banker who mysteriously disappeared in protest after he was given a court order to lend money to an incompetent applicant. When the order came down, he liquidated his entire business, paid off his depositors, and joined Galt's strike. He is the legal owner of the land where Galt's Gulch is located. Mulligan's birth name was Michael, but he had it legally changed after a news article called him &quot;[[Midas]]&quot; in a derogatory fashion, which Mulligan took as a compliment.
*'''Judge Narragansett''' is an American jurist who ruled in favor of Midas Mulligan during the case brought against him by the incompetent loan applicant. When Narragansett's ruling was reversed on appeal, he retired and joined the strike. At the end of the novel, he is seen editing the [[United States Constitution]], crossing out the contradicting amendments of it and adding an amendment to prohibit Congress from passing laws that restrain freedom of trade.
*'''Ben Nealy''' is a railroad contractor whom Dagny Taggart hires to replace the track on the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal. Nealy is incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country. Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power. He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement. He relies on Dagny and Ellis Wyatt to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around.
*'''Ted Nielsen''' is the head of Nielsen Motors. He eventually goes on strike, along with most of the other industrialist &quot;producer&quot; types, by closing his motor factory. Dagny later finds him when she visits Galt's Gulch for the first time.
*'''Betty Pope''' is a wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with James Taggart. She is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position.
*'''Dr. Potter''' holds some undefined position with the State Science Institute. He is sent to try to obtain the rights to Rearden Metal.
*'''Dr. Simon Pritchett''' is the prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University and is considered the leading philosopher of the age. He believes that man is nothing but a collection of chemicals, reason is a superstition, it is futile to seek meaning in life, and the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood.
*'''Rearden's mother''', whose name is not mentioned, lives with Rearden at his home in Philadelphia. She is involved in charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can. She dotes on her weak son Philip Rearden.
*'''Philip Rearden''' is the younger brother of Hank Rearden. He lives in his brother's home in Philadelphia and is completely dependent on him. He is resentful of his brother's charity.
*'''Dwight Sanders''' owns Sanders Aircraft, a producer of high-quality airplanes, and joins the strike.
*'''Bertram Scudder''' is an editorial writer for the magazine ''The Future''. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on Hank Rearden called ''The Octopus''. He is also vocal in support of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. Scudder claims that the most important thing in life is &quot;brother love&quot; but seems to have nothing but hatred for those around him. He loses his job after Dagny Taggart reveals her affair with Hank Rearden over air on his radio show.
*'''Claude Slagenhop''' is president of political organization Friends of Global Progress and one of Lillian Rearden's friends. He believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action. Global Progress is a sponsor of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.
*'''Gerald and Ivy Starnes''' are the two surviving children of Jed Starnes, the founder of the Twentieth Century Motor Company. Together with their since-deceased brother Eric, they instituted a communistic payment-and-benefits program that drove the company into bankruptcy. Gerald, a dying alcoholic, and Ivy, a [[New Age|pseudo-Buddhist]] ascetic, continue to insist that the plan was perfect and that the failure of their father's company was entirely due to the workers. Eric was a weak, attention-seeking man with a pathological desire to be loved. He committed suicide after the woman he loved married another man. Gerald claims that he always acted for the good of the employees, but he was vain and incompetent and often threw lavish parties using company funds. Ivy, on the other hand, is described as a sadist who relishes seeing others in poverty, but who has no desire for wealth of her own.
*'''Andrew Stockton''' runs the Stockton Foundry in Stockton, Colorado. When he joins the strike, he opens a foundry in Galt's Gulch.
*'''Nathaniel &quot;Nat&quot; Taggart''' was the founder of Taggart Transcontinental. He built his railroad without any government handouts, and ran the business for no other reason than to turn a profit. He began as a penniless adventurer and ended up as one of the wealthiest men in the country. He never earned money by force or fraud (except for bribing government officials and throwing an opponent down a flight of stairs), and never apologized for becoming wealthy and successful. He was one of the most hated men of his time. Dagny is often inspired by looking at a statue of Nat Taggart at the railroad headquarters, and draws a dollar sign on its base as a signal to Francisco when she is ready to join Galt's strike.  It is suspected that he is modeled after James Jerome Hill, builder of the Great Northern Railroad. 
*'''Mr. Thompson''' is the &quot;[[Head of state|Head of the State]]&quot; for the United States. He is not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rand's notes indicate that she modeled him on President [[Harry S. Truman]], and that she deliberately decided not to call him &quot;President of the United States&quot; as this title has &quot;honorable connotations&quot; which the character does not deserve.
*'''Lester Tuck''' is the campaign manager for Kip Chalmers and one of his guests on the train trip to California. He dies in the Taggart Tunnel disaster.
*'''Clem Weatherby''' is a government representative on the board of directors of Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny considers him the least bad of the government representatives, since he does have some real knowledge on the running of trains. She notices, however, that he is the least appreciated by his own bosses.
*The '''Wet Nurse (Tony)''' is a young bureaucrat sent by the government to watch over Rearden's mills. Though he starts out as a cynical follower of the looters' code, his experience at the mills transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers. He is shot attempting to inform Hank Rearden about a government plot, but does succeed in warning Rearden just before he dies.
*'''Ellis Wyatt''' is the head of Wyatt Oil. He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of Colorado by discovering a new process for extracting more oil from what were thought to be exhausted oil wells. When first introduced, he is aggressive towards Dagny, whom he does not yet know and whom he blames for what are, in fact, her brother's policies which directly threaten his business. When the government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him to continue, he sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a jeering note: &quot;I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours.&quot; One particular burning well that resists all efforts to extinguish it becomes known as &quot;Wyatt's Torch&quot;. Later Dagny meets him in Galt's Gulch.

'''Anthropology''' is the [[Science|scientific study]] of [[human]]s, [[human behavior]] and [[society|societies]] in the past and present.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web | title=anthropology | url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology |work=Oxford Dictionaries | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology | title=anthropology | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{cite web | title=What is Anthropology? | url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm | publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]] | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anthropology]] studies patterns of behaviour and [[cultural anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; studies cultural meaning, including norms and values. [[Linguistic anthropology]] studies how language influences social life. [[Biological anthropology|Biological or physical anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; studies the biological development of humans. [[Visual anthropology]], which is usually considered to be a part of social anthropology, can mean both [[ethnographic film]] (where photography, film, and [[new media]] are used for study) as well as the study of &quot;visuals&quot;, including art, visual images, cinema etc. [[Oxford Bibliographies]] describes visual anthropology as &quot;the anthropological study of the visual and the visual study of the anthropological&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0028.xml|title=Visual Anthropology|website=obo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archaeology]], which studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence, is considered a branch of anthropology in the United States and Canada, while in Europe it is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history.

==Origin and development of the term==

{{main|History of anthropology}}
The abstract noun ''[[wikt:anthropology|anthropology]]'' is first attested in reference to [[history]].&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[Richard Harvey (astrologer)|Richard Harvey]]'s 1593 ''Philadelphus'', a defense of the legend of [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] in [[History of Britain|British history]], includes the passage &quot;Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did.

===Through the 19th century===
In 1647, the Bartholins, founders of the [[University of Copenhagen]], defined ''{{lang|fr|l'anthropologie}}'' as follows:&lt;ref name=frenchy&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bartholin | first1=Caspar | last2=Bartholin | first2=Thomas | author-link1=Caspar Bartholin the Younger | author-link2=Thomas Bartholin | others=Translated from the Latin by Abr.

Hénault et J. Hénault | chapter=Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
Anthropology, that is to say the science that treats of man, is divided ordinarily and with reason into Anatomy, which considers the body and the parts, and Psychology, which speaks of the soul.{{refn|group=n|In French: ''L'Anthropologie, c'est à dire la science qui traite de l'homme, est divisée ordinairment &amp; avec raison en l'Anatomie, qui considere le corps &amp; les parties, et en la Psychologie, qui parle de l'Ame''.&lt;ref name=frenchy/&gt;}}
}}
Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by [[Étienne Serres]] in 1839 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the [[National Museum of Natural History, France|French National Museum of Natural History]] by [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau]]. Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed. The [[Société Ethnologique de Paris]], the first to use [[Ethnology]], was formed in 1839. Its members were primarily anti-slavery activists. When slavery was abolished in France in 1848 the Société was abandoned.

Meanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the [[American Ethnological Society]], was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the [[Ethnological Society of London]] in 1843, a break-away group of the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]].&lt;ref name=Schiller131&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|pp=130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-[[Human rights|human-rights activists.]] They maintained international connections.

Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in such diverse fields as [[comparative anatomy|anatomy]], [[Comparative method (linguistics)|linguistics]], and [[Ethnology]], making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in [[agronomy]] and in the wild.

Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. [[Paul Broca]] in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the [[Société de biologie]] to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the [[Society of Anthropology of Paris|Société d'Anthropologie de Paris]], meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859.&lt;ref name=Fletcher&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Fletcher | chapter=Paul Broca and the French School of Anthropology | title=The Saturday Lectures, Delivered in the Lecture-room of the U. S. National Museum under the Auspices of the Anthropological and Biological Societies of Washington in March and April 1882 | year=1882 | location=Boston; Washington, DC | publisher=D. Lothrop &amp; Co.; Judd &amp; Detweiler | chapter-url={{Google books|9dEJAQAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|As [[Robert Fletcher (anthropologist)|Fletcher]] points out, the French society was by no means the first to include anthropology or parts of it as its topic. Previous organizations used other names. The German Anthropological Association of St. Petersburg, however, in fact met first in 1861, but due to the death of its founder never met again.&lt;ref name=Fletcher/&gt;}} When he read Darwin, he became an immediate convert to ''Transformisme'', as the French called [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; His definition now became &quot;the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broca, being what today would be called a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]], had taken an interest in the pathology of speech. He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called [[Broca's area]] after him. His interest was mainly in [[Biological anthropology]], but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, [[Theodor Waitz]], took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled ''Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker'', 1859–1864. The title was soon translated as &quot;The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples&quot;. The last two volumes were published posthumously.

Waitz defined anthropology as &quot;the science of the nature of man&quot;. Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from &quot;the animals nearest to him&quot;. He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of civilization, as well as ethnology, are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that &quot;the same laws of thought are applicable to all men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waitz was influential among the British ethnologists. In 1863 the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] and the speech therapist [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] broke away from the [[Ethnological Society of London]] to form the [[Anthropological Society of London]], which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French ''Société'' were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, ''The Anthropological Review'', Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard.&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|loc=Introductory Address}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Hunt's choice of theorists does not exclude the numerous other theorists that were beginning to publish a large volume of anthropological studies.&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt;}} Among the first associates were the young [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], inventor of [[cultural anthropology]], and his brother [[Alfred Tylor]], a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.

Similar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the [[Berliner Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte|Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory]] (1869) founded by [[Rudolph Virchow]], known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation.

During the last three decades of the 19th century, a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898 the American Association for the Advancement of Science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology.

This meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world's higher educational institutions, many thousands in number. Anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. Practical anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene. The organization has reached global level. For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA), &quot;a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology&quot;, currently contains members from about three dozen nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Home | publisher=World Council of Anthropological Associations | accessdate=29 March 2015 | url= http://www.wcaanet.org/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the work of [[Franz Boas]] and [[Bronisław Malinowski]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, ''social'' anthropology in Great Britain and [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'' anthropology]] in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on [[cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]], long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance they place on [[Participant observation|participant-observation]] or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology, in particular, has emphasized [[cultural relativism]], [[holism]], and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79&quot;&gt;Hylland Eriksen, Thomas. (2004) &quot;What is Anthropology&quot; Pluto. London. p. 79. {{ISBN|0-7453-2320-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from [[Boasian anthropology|Boas' arguments]] against 19th-century racial [[ideology]], through [[Margaret Mead]]'s advocacy for [[gender equality]] and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of [[post-colonialism|post-colonial]] oppression and promotion of [[multiculturalism]]. [[Ethnography]] is one of its primary [[research design]]s as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994p331&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiro1987&quot;&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E.

In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of [[social anthropology]] tends to dominate. In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the [[four field approach]] developed by [[Franz Boas]] in the early 20th century: [[Biological anthropology|''biological'' or ''physical'' anthropology]]; [[social anthropology|''social'']], [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'']], or [[sociocultural anthropology|''sociocultural'' anthropology]]; and [[archaeology]]; plus [[linguistic anthropology|anthropological linguistics]]. These fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.

European countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more [[ethnology]] (a term coined and defined by [[Adam František Kollár|Adam F. Kollár]] in 1783). It is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert (1998) ''An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology''.

{{further|American anthropology}}

Anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from [[natural science]]s, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'', human physical traits, [[human behavior]], the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of ''Homo sapiens'' has influenced its social organization and culture, and from [[social science]]s, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm What is Anthropology – American Anthropological Association].

Living Anthropologically. Retrieved on 2017-17-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Early anthropology originated in Classical Greece and Persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity, such as by [[Al-Biruni]] of the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ahmed | first1 = Akbar S. | year = 1984 | title = Al-Beruni: The First Anthropologist | journal = RAIN | volume = 60 | issue = 60| pages = 9–10 | doi = 10.2307/3033407 | jstor = 3033407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Other Religions: Al-Biruni's and Gadamer's &quot;fusion of Horizons&quot;
By Kemal Ataman page 59&lt;/ref&gt; As such, anthropology has been central in the development of several new (late 20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as [[cognitive science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Language, Anthropology and Cognitive Science |author=Bloch, Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Bloch |jstor=2803828 |year=1991 |pages=183–198 |volume=26 |issue=2 |journal=Man |doi=10.2307/2803828 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[global studies]], and various [[ethnic studies]].

According to [[Clifford Geertz]],
{{quotation|&quot;anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth-century conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact. Long after natural history, moral philosophy, philology, and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors, it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology, human biology, comparative linguistics, and prehistory, held together mainly by the vested interests, sunk costs, and administrative habits of academia, and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London|pages=Back Cover|editor1=Daniel A. Segal |editor2=Sylvia J. Yanagisako |isbn=978-0-8223-8684-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sociocultural anthropology]] has been heavily influenced by [[structuralism|structuralist]] and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an [[epistemological]] shift away from the [[positivist]] traditions that had largely informed the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Behar, Clifford &amp; James&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.

===Sociocultural===
{{main|Cultural anthropology|Social anthropology|Sociocultural anthropology}}
Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[social anthropology]]. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people ''make sense'' of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the ''relationships'' among individuals and groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994pxv&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=General Introduction | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold| year=1994 | pages=xv |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-02137-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural anthropology is more related to [[philosophy]], literature and [[the arts]] (how one's culture affects the experience for self and group, contributing to a more complete understanding of the people's knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to [[sociology]] and history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994pxv&quot;/&gt; In that, it helps develop an understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.

Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by [[cultural relativism]], the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994p331&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Introduction to culture | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold | year=1994 | page=331 |isbn=978-0-415-02137-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1996p18&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Key Debates in Anthropology | author=Tim Ingold | year=1996|  page=18|quote=the traditional anthropological project of cross-cultural or cross-societal comparison| author-link=Tim Ingold }}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is often accommodated in the field of [[ethnography]]. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic [[monograph]]. As a methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. [[Participant observation]] is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernard |first=H. Russell |year=2002 |url=http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |title=Research Methods in Anthropology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104002847/http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |archive-date=4 November 2016 |publisher=[[Altamira Press]] |page=322 |isbn=978-0-7591-0868-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethnology]] involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an [[emic]] (conceptual, vs. [[etic]], or technical) point of view.

The study of [[kinship]] and [[social organization]] is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a [[human universal]]. Sociocultural anthropology also covers [[Economic anthropology|economic]] and [[Political anthropology|political organization]], law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).

Comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology, including the industrialized (and de-industrialized) West. The [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]] (SCCS) includes 186 such cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;MurdockWhite1969&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Standard Cross-Cultural Sample | journal=Ethnology | author=George Peter Murdock | author2=Douglas R.

{{main|Biological anthropology}}
[[File:Human remains.jpg|thumb|left|[[Forensic anthropology|Forensic anthropologists]] can help identify skeletonized human remains, such as these found lying in scrub in Western Australia, c. 1900–1910.]]

Biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions. It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[University of Toronto]] |title=Research Subfields: Physical or Biological |access-date=14 March 2012 |url=http://anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422203737/http://www.anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological===
{{main|Archaeology}}
[[Archaeology]] is the study of the human past through its material remains. Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies. Archaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices. Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, R.H. &amp; Larkin, S.N.

[[File:Rosetta Stone.svg|thumb|The Rosetta Stone was an example of ancient communication.]]

===Linguistic===
{{main|Linguistic anthropology}}
[[Linguistic anthropology]] (not to be confused with [[anthropological linguistics]]) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2150|title=What is Anthropology? – Advance Your Career|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Salzmann, Zdeněk. (1993) ''Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key topics by field: sociocultural ==

===Art, media, music, dance and film===
{{Anthropology of art}}

==== Art ====
{{main|Anthropology of art}}

One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert. (1981) ''The Anthropology of Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' ''Primitive Art'', [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' ''The Way of the Masks'' (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.

==== Media ====
{{main|Media anthropology}}
[[File:Punu mask Gabon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Punu tribe mask, Gabon, Central Africa]]
Media anthropology (also known as the anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media. Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movement]]s, or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]], and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spitulnik, Deborah |title=Anthropology and Mass Media|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=22|page=293|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.22.100193.001453|url=http://www.philbu.net/media-anthropology/Spitulnik_MediaAnthro.pdf|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abu-Lughod, Lila |year=1997|title=The Interpretation of Cultures after Television|journal=Representations|volume= 59|issue=59|pages= 109–133|url=https://direitosehumanos.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/a-interpretac3a7c3a3o-das-culturas-depois-da-televisc3a3o.pdf|jstor=2928817|doi=10.1525/rep.1997.59.1.99p0026o}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Music ====
{{main|Ethnomusicology}}
[[Ethnomusicology]] is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.

[[Ethnomusicology]] can be used in a wide variety of fields, such as teaching, politics, cultural anthropology etc.  While the origins of ethnomusicology date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, it was formally introduced as “ethnomusicology” by Dutch scholar [[Jaap Kunst]] around 1950. Later, the influence of study in this area spawned the creation of the periodical ''[[Ethnomusicology (academic journal)|Ethnomusicology]]'' and the [[Society for Ethnomusicology|Society of Ethnomusicology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ethnomusicology|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/ethnomusicology|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Visual ====
{{main|Visual anthropology}}
Visual anthropology is concerned, in part, with the study and production of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, [[new media]]. While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with [[ethnographic film]], visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and [[reception theory|reception]] of [[anthropology of media|mass media]]. Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings, and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.

=== Economic, political economic, applied and development ===
{{Economic anthropology}}

==== Economic ====
{{main|Economic anthropology}}
Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of anthropology, [[Bronisław Malinowski]], and his French compatriot, [[Marcel Mauss]], on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]]) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hann|first=Chris|title=Economic Anthropology|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=55–71|author2=Hart, Keith |isbn=978-0-7456-4482-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the [[global financial system]] from an anthropological perspective.

====Political economy====
{{main|Political economy in anthropology}}
Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the &quot;pre-capitalist&quot; societies that were subject to evolutionary &quot;tribal&quot; stereotypes. Sahlin's work on hunter-gatherers as the &quot;original affluent society&quot; did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist [[world-system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roseberry 1988 161–85&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161–185|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

==== Applied ====
{{main|Applied anthropology}}
Applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a &quot;complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|isbn=978-0-275-97841-9|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to [[development anthropology]] (distinct from the more critical [[anthropology of development]]).

====Development====
{{main|anthropology of development}}
Anthropology of development tends to view development from a ''critical'' perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short, why does so much planned development fail?

===Kinship, feminism, gender and sexuality===
{{Anthropology of kinship}}

==== Kinship ====
{{main|Kinship}}
''Kinship'' can refer both to ''the study of'' the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to ''the patterns of social relationships'' themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as &quot;[[kinship|descent]]&quot;, &quot;[[descent group]]s&quot;, &quot;[[lineage (anthropology)|lineages]]&quot;, &quot;[[affinity (law)|affines]]&quot;, &quot;[[cognatic kinship|cognates]]&quot;, and even &quot;[[fictive kinship]]&quot;. Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one's social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage. Within kinship you have two different families. People have their biological families and it is the people they share DNA with. This is called consanguineal relations or &quot;blood ties&quot;[http://content.inflibnet.ac.in/data-server/eacharya-documents/5717528c8ae36ce69422587d_INFIEP_304/66/ET/304-66-ET-V1-S1__file1.pdf ]. People can also have a chosen family [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/being-unlonely/201906/finding-connection-through-chosen-family Finding Connection Through &quot;Chosen Family&quot;] in which they chose who they want to be a part of their family. In some cases people are closer with their chosen family more than with their biological families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pountney, Laura|title=Introducing anthropology|others=Maric, Tomislav|date=5 October 2015|isbn=978-0-7456-9977-6|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=909318382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feminist ====
{{main|Feminist anthropology}}
Feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ([[archaeology|archeological]], [[biological anthropology|biological]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]]. Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies. Feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940.html | title=Springer Reference – Meteor}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a specialization.

The first [[African-American]] female [[anthropologist]] and [[Caribbeanist]] is said to be [[Vera Mae Green]] who studied ethnic and family relations in the [[Caribbean]] as well as the United States, and thereby tried to improve the way black life, experiences, and culture were studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1525/aa.1982.84.3.02a00080|title = Vera Mae Green, 1928–1982| journal=American Anthropologist| volume=84| issue=3| pages=633–635|date = September 1982|last1 = Cole|first1 = Johnnetta B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical, nutritional, psychological, cognitive and transpersonal===
{{Medical anthropology}}

==== Medical ====
{{main|Medical anthropology}}

Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies &quot;human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation&quot;.&lt;ref name=McElroy1996&gt;{{Cite book |year=1996 |author=McElroy, A |chapter=Medical Anthropology |editor1=D.

Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole. It focuses on the following six basic fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Dave|date=24 October 2016|title=Anthropology's Contribution to Public Health Policy Development|journal=McGill Journal of Medicine : MJM|volume=13|issue=1|page=76|issn=1201-026X|pmc=3277334|pmid=22363184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
* the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care
* the patient-physician relationship
* the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments
* the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole
* the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations (&quot;critical ethnopsychiatry&quot;: Beneduce 2004, 2007)
* the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings
}}

Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as ''cultural psychiatry'' and ''transcultural psychiatry'' or ''ethnopsychiatry''.

==== Nutritional ====
{{main|Nutritional anthropology}}

Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.

==== Psychological ====
{{main|Psychological anthropology}}
Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of [[cultural anthropology|cultural]] and [[psychology|mental processes]]. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and [[enculturation]] within a particular cultural group&amp;nbsp;–  with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories&amp;nbsp;–  shape processes of human [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[perception]], [[motivation]], and [[mental health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeVine, R.

==== Cognitive ====
{{main|Cognitive anthropology}}
Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Andrade&quot;/&gt;

==== Transpersonal ====
{{main|Transpersonal anthropology}}
Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and culture. As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues –  for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schroll, M.

===Political and legal===
{{Political anthropology}}

==== Political ====
{{main|Political anthropology}}
Political anthropology concerns the structure of [[Form of government|political systems]], looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more &quot;complex&quot; social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. Firstly, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Secondly, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz' comparative work on &quot;Negara&quot;, the Balinese state, is an early, famous example.

====Legal====
{{main|Legal anthropology}}
Legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in &quot;the cross-cultural study of social ordering&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Greenhouse, Carol J. | title = Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |isbn=978-0-8014-1971-3| location = Ithaca | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. More recent applications include issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world|year=2006|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|editor1=Hent de Vries |editor2=Lawrence E. Sullivan }}&lt;/ref&gt; and political uprisings.

====Public====
{{main|Public anthropology}}
Public anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to &quot;demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicanthropology.org/|title=Center for a Public Anthropology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature, science, and technology ===
{{Cyber anthropology}}

====Cyborg====
{{main|Cyborg anthropology}}
Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s annual meeting in 1993. The sub-group was very closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie (2001). &quot;Cyborg Anthropology&quot;. in ''Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-92092-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donna Haraway]]'s 1985 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto]]'' could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.

==== Digital ====
{{main|Digital anthropology}}
Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and [[technology]] intersect. It is sometimes grouped with [[cultural anthropology|sociocultural anthropology]], and sometimes considered part of [[material culture]]. The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases. These include techno-anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.studyguide.aau.dk/programmes/postgraduate/53203/ | title=Techno-Anthropology course guide | publisher=Aalborg University | accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital ethnography, cyberanthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://xirdalium.net/category/anthropology/cyberanthropology/ | title=Cyberanthropology | publisher=Peter Hammer Verlag Gmbh | date=August 2011 | accessdate=14 March 2013 | author=Knorr, Alexander | isbn=978-3-7795-0359-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virtual anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Virtual Anthropology: A guide to a new interdisciplinary field | publisher=Springer |author1=Weber, Gerhard |author2=Bookstein, Fred | year=2011 | isbn=978-3-211-48647-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ecological ====
{{main|Ecological anthropology}}
Ecological anthropology is defined as the &quot;study of [[cultural adaptation]]s to environments&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kottak&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kottak|first=Conrad Phillip|title=Anthropology : appreciating human diversity|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811699-5|pages=579–584|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field is also defined as, &quot;the study of relationships between a population of humans and their [[biophysical environment]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Townsend&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Patricia K.|title=Environmental anthropology : from pigs to policies|year=2009|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Ill.|isbn=978-1-57766-581-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/environmentalant0000town/page/104 104]|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/environmentalant0000town/page/104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of its research concerns &quot;how cultural [[beliefs]] and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how their environments change across space and time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kottak CP 1999&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kottak|first1=Conrad P.|jstor=683339|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|issue=1|pages=23–35|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227632647|hdl=2027.42/66329|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is [[political ecology]]. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, century anthropology and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pyke G 1984&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyke|first1=G H|title=Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=15|page=523|year=1984|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243636746}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Checker M 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Checker|title=Polluted promises: environmental racism and the search for justice in a southern town|url=https://archive.org/details/pollutedpromises0000chec|url-access=registration|date=August 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
{{main|Ethnohistory}} {{see also|Historical anthropology}}
Ethnohistory is the study of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] cultures and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] customs by examining [[History|historical records]]. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not exist today. Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, [[folklore]], oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and place names.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell1979&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint |  journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi = 10.2307/481465 | jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Anthropology of religion}}
{{main|Anthropology of religion}}
The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between [[magical thinking]] and religion,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassirer1944&quot;&gt;[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''An Essay On Man''], pt.II, ch.7 ''Myth and Religion'', pp.&amp;nbsp;122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|&quot;It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.]&amp;nbsp;... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassirer1944&quot;/&gt;}} and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human [[community]] that worships it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guthrie2000p225&quot;&gt;Guthrie (2000) ''Guide to the Study of Religion''.

=== Urban ===
{{main|Urban anthropology}}
Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of [[urbanization]], poverty, and [[neoliberalism]]. [[Ulf Hannerz]] quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were &quot;a notoriously [[agoraphobic]] lot, anti-urban by definition&quot;. Various social processes in the [[Western World]] as well as in the &quot;[[Third World]]&quot; (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of &quot;[[Anthropology#Focus on the &quot;other cultures&quot;|specialists in 'other cultures']]&quot; closer to their homes.&lt;ref name=Hannerz/&gt; There are two main approaches to urban anthropology: examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1466138110370412 |jstor=24047982|title=Chinese consumers: The Romantic reappraisal|journal=Ethnography|volume=11|issue=3|pages=331–357|year=2010|last1=Griffiths|first1=M.

{{main|Archaeological|Biological anthropology}}

=== Anthrozoology ===
{{main|Anthrozoology}}
[[Anthrozoology]] (also known as &quot;human–animal studies&quot;) is the study of interaction between living things. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, [[ethology]], medicine, [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]]. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 &quot;Anthrozoology&quot;], ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''. CABI, pp. 28–30. {{ISBN|0-85199-724-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Margo (2010).

=== Biocultural ===
{{main|Biocultural anthropology}}
Biocultural anthropology is the [[scientific]] exploration of the relationships between [[human biology]] and culture. [[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] perspective; that is, from the assumption that [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] human biological differences lead to cultural differences.&lt;ref name=Biocult_syn&gt;{{cite book |last= Goodman |first=Alan H. |author2= Thomas L. Leatherman (eds.) |title=Building A New Biocultural Synthesis |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year= 1998 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T8ZhpG_B_6MC |isbn= 978-0-472-06606-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology.

=== Evolutionary ===
{{main|Evolutionary anthropology}}
Evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominins]] and non-hominin [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]], combining the [[Human development (biology)|human development]] with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as [[archaeology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], [[primatology]], and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

=== Forensic ===
{{main|Forensic anthropology}}
Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of [[physical anthropology]] and human [[osteology]] in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victim's remains are in the advanced stages of [[decomposition]]. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable. The adjective &quot;forensic&quot; refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.

=== Palaeoanthropology ===
{{main|Palaeoanthropology}}
[[File:LuzonensisMolars.jpg|thumb|Five of the seven known fossil teeth of ''[[Homo luzonensis]]'' found in [[Callao Cave]].]]
Paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of [[paleontology]] and [[physical anthropology]]. It is the study of ancient humans, as found in [[fossil]] [[Hominidae|hominid]] evidence such as [[Petrifaction|petrifacted]] bones and footprints. Genetics and morphology of specimens are crucially important to this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelso|first=Janet|last2=Pääbo|first2=Svante|last3=Meyer|first3=Matthias|last4=Prüfer|first4=Kay|last5=Reich|first5=David|last6=Patterson|first6=Nick|last7=Slatkin|first7=Montgomery|last8=Nickel|first8=Birgit|last9=Nagel|first9=Sarah|date=March 2018|title=Reconstructing the genetic history of late Neanderthals|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=555|issue=7698|pages=652–656|doi=10.1038/nature26151|pmid=29562232|pmc=6485383|issn=1476-4687|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/70268/Hajdinjak_2018_T.pdf?sequence=1|bibcode=2018Natur.555..652H|hdl=1887/70268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markers on specimens, such as [[enamel fracture]]s and [[Tooth decay|dental decay]] on [[Tooth|teeth]], can also give insight into the behaviour and diet of past populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1002/ajpa.23250 |pmid=28542710|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317189250|title=Behavioral inferences from the high levels of dental chipping in Homo naledi|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=164|issue=1|pages=184–192|year=2017|last1=Towle|first1=Ian|last2=Irish|first2=Joel D.|last3=De Groote|first3=Isabelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==
Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of anthropologists is the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA), which was founded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/ AAAnet.org]. AAAnet.org. Retrieved on 2 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Its members are anthropologists from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=13 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613021448/http://aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf|archive-date=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the [[European Association of Social Anthropologists]] (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe. The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.

Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[anatomy]], [[music theory]], [[art history]], [[sociology]] and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald and Wong, Kate (2007).

==Ethics==
As the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves, and professional societies have generated codes of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report of the Commission to Review the AAA Statements on Ethics – Participate &amp; Advocate|url=http://www.americananthro.org/ParticipateAndAdvocate/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1911&amp;RDtoken=3371&amp;userID=6944|publisher=American Anthropological Association|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.&lt;ref name = &quot;pbuteh&quot;&gt;Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) ''Anthropology &amp; the Colonial Encounter.'' Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) ''Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania''. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have contended:
* That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derives some of its key notions from it, consciously or not. (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).&lt;ref name=Gellner&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) [http://okhovvat.com/files/en/content/2011/6/4/351_379.pdf ''Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion'']. London/New York: Routledge. pp. 26–29. {{ISBN|0-415-08024-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That ethnographic work is often [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]], writing about people as if they were &quot;out of time&quot; in an &quot;ethnographic present&quot; (Johannes Fabian, ''Time and Its Other'').

=== Cultural relativism ===
As part of their quest for [[scientific objectivity]], present-day anthropologists typically urge [[cultural relativism]], which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingold1994p331&quot;/&gt; This is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another's values or viewpoints, but be examined dispassionately on their own terms. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Strauss, Claude (1962). ''The Savage Mind''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Womack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human''..{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], [[racism]], [[mutilation]] (including [[circumcision]] and [[subincision]]), and [[torture]]. Topics like racism, slavery, and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin. ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; to genes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&amp;sectioncode=26 Is there a gene for racism? | Times Higher Education (THE)]. Times Higher Education (27 October 2016). Retrieved on 2 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[acculturation]] have been proposed, not to mention theories of [[colonialism]] and many others as root causes of [[Man's inhumanity to man]]. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as &quot;racism&quot; and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on &quot;Race&quot;|url=http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm|publisher=American Anthropological Association|date=May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.282.5389.654 |pmid=9841421 |title=Cultural Anthropology: DNA Studies Challenge the Meaning of Race |journal=Science |volume=282 |issue=5389 |pages=654–655 |year=1998 |last1=Marshall |first1=E. |bibcode=1998Sci...282..654M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Allan (1995). &quot;The Problematics of &quot;Race&quot; in Contemporary Biological Anthropology.&quot; In ''Biological Anthropology: The State of the Science''.

Ortiz|url=https://www.academia.edu/199944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military involvement===
Anthropologists' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Browman|first=David|date=22 November 2011|title=Spying by American Archaeologists in World War I|journal=Bulletin of the History of Archaeology|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=10–17|doi=10.5334/bha.2123|issn=2047-6930|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the [[Axis Powers]] (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, [[David Price (anthropologist)|David H. Price]]'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=David H.|date=1 June 1998|title=Cold war anthropology: Collaborators and victims of the national security state|journal=Identities|volume=4|issue=3–4|pages=389–430|doi=10.1080/1070289X.1998.9962596|issn=1070-289X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little. Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement. Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The [[Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth]] (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous. The &quot;Principles of Professional Responsibility&quot; issued by the American Anthropological Association and amended through November 1986 stated that &quot;in relation with their own government and with host governments&amp;nbsp;... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americananthro.org/ParticipateAndAdvocate/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1656|title=Past AAA Statements on Ethics – Participate &amp; Advocate|website=www.americananthro.org|access-date=2 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current &quot;Principles of Professional Responsibility&quot; does not make explicit mention of ethics surrounding state interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethics.americananthro.org/category/statement/|title=Ethics Forum » Full Text of the 2012 Ethics Statement|website=Ethics Forum|access-date=2 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army's strategy in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm US Army's strategy in Afghanistan: better anthropology]. CSMonitor.com (7 September 2007). Retrieved on 2 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' reports that &quot;Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs&quot; [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]], under the ''[[Human Terrain System]]'' (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the [[US military in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century |url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121225645/http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archivedate=21 January 2014 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the American Anthropological Association's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, &quot;When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology. In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of &quot;anthropology&quot; within DoD.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.aaanet.org/2009/12/08/aaa-commission-releases-final-report-on-army-human-terrain-system/ &quot;AAA Commission Releases Final Report on Army Human Terrain System&quot;].

==Post–World War II developments==
Before [[WWII]] British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

===Basic trends===
There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[Holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79&quot;/&gt; The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.

In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato (1993).  ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. Inda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xavier, John and Rosaldo, Renato (2007).  ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation&lt;ref&gt;Jurmain, Robert; Kilgore, Lynn; Trevathan, Wenda and Ciochon, Russell L. (2007).  ''Introduction to Physical Anthropology''. 11th Edition. Wadsworth. chapters I, III and IV. {{ISBN|0-495-18779-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wompack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human''. Prentice Hall. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–20. {{ISBN|0-13-644071-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald (1991).  ''Human Universals''. McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughley, Neil (2000).  ''Being Humans: Anthropological Universality and Particularity in Transciplinary Perspectives''. Walter de Gruyter Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; They use many different methods of study, but modern population [[genetics]], [[participant observation]] and other techniques often take anthropologists &quot;into the field,&quot; which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called &quot;fieldwork.&quot;  On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.

Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of [[comparative method]], a central part of their science.

===Commonalities between fields===
Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see [[History of anthropology]]), including but not limited to [[Fossil collecting|fossil-hunting]], [[Exploration|exploring]], documentary film-making, [[paleontology]], [[primatology]], antiquity dealings and curatorship, [[philology]], [[etymology]], [[genetics]], regional analysis, [[ethnology]], history, [[philosophy]], and [[religious studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D. Murphy (2003). ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. Broadview Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12. {{ISBN|1-4426-0110-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George (1992) &quot;Paradigmatic Traditions in the History of Anthropology&quot;, pp. 342–361 in George Stocking, ''The Ethnographer's Magic and Other Essays in the History of Anthropology''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0-299-13414-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, Murray (1979). ''Man, Mind and Science: A History of Anthropology.'' Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of &quot;other cultures&quot;, both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).&lt;ref&gt;See the many essays relating to this in Prem Poddar and David Johnson, Historical Companion to Postcolonial Thought in English, Edinburgh University Press, 2004. See also Prem Poddar et al., Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures&amp;nbsp;–  Continental Europe and its Empires, Edinburgh University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the classic of [[urban anthropology]], [[Ulf Hannerz]] in the introduction to his seminal ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'' mentions that the &quot;[[Third World]]&quot; had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in &quot;other cultures&quot; looked for them far away and started to look &quot;across the tracks&quot; only in late 1960s.&lt;ref name=Hannerz&gt;[[Ulf Hannerz|Hannerz, Ulf]] (1980) ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'', {{ISBN|0-231-08376-9}}, p. 1. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's &quot;home&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/682051 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences]'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' &quot;100:&quot; 716–731&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and [[Sociology]], on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody|Goody, Jack]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC The Theft of History]''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-87069-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to [[sociologist]]s, but this is increasingly changing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Abélès | first1 = Marc | title = How the Anthropology of France Has Changed Anthropology in France: Assessing New Directions in the Field |journal = [[Cultural Anthropology (journal)|Cultural Anthropology]] | volume = 1999 | page = 407 | jstor = 08867356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like ''[[Terrain (journal)|Terrain]]'' (&quot;fieldwork&quot;), and developing with the center founded by [[Marc Augé]] (''[[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains]]'', the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).

Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale. There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Michael M. J. (2003) ''Emergent Forms of Life and the Anthropological Voice''. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Agriculture|related}}
'''Agricultural science''' is a broad multidisciplinary field of [[biology]] that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and [[social science]]s that are used in the practice and understanding of [[agriculture]]. ([[veterinary medicine|Veterinary science]], but not [[animal science]], is often excluded from the definition.)

==Agriculture, agricultural science, and agronomy==

The three terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:

*'''Agriculture''' is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.
*'''[[Agronomy]]''' is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based crops.

'''Agricultural sciences''' include research and development on:&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosso 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Bosso | first=Thelma | title=Agricultural Science | publisher=Callisto Reference | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-63239-058-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boucher 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Boucher | first=Jude | title=Agricultural Science and Management | publisher=Callisto Reference  | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-63239-965-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plant breeding and genetics
* Plant pathology
*[[Horticulture]]
* Soil science
* Entomology
* Production techniques (e.g., [[irrigation]] management, recommended [[nitrogen]] inputs)
* Improving [[agricultural productivity]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[drought]]-resistant crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques)
* Minimizing the effects of pests ([[weed]]s, [[insect]]s, [[pathogen]]s, [[nematode]]s) on crop or animal production systems.
* Transformation of primary products into end-consumer products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s)
* Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], [[waste management]], [[bioremediation]])
* [[Theoretical production ecology]], relating to crop production modeling
* Traditional agricultural systems, sometimes termed [[subsistence agriculture]], which feed most of the poorest people in the world.  These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of [[industrial agriculture]], which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems.
* Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as China, India, Brazil, the US and the EU.
* Various sciences relating to agricultural resources and the environment (e.g. soil science, agroclimatology); biology of agricultural crops and animals (e.g. crop science, animal science and their included sciences, e.g. ruminant nutrition, farm animal welfare); such fields as agricultural economics and rural sociology; various disciplines encompassed in agricultural engineering.

===Agricultural biotechnology===
[[Agricultural biotechnology]] is a specific area of agricultural science involving the use of scientific tools and techniques, including [[genetic engineering]], [[molecular marker]]s, [[molecular diagnostics]], [[vaccine]]s, and [[tissue culture]], to modify living organisms: plants, animals, and [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://absp2.cornell.edu/resources/briefs/documents/warp_briefs_eng_scr.pdf | title=What is Agricultural Biotechnology? | publisher=Cornell University | accessdate=3 February 2015 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226020957/http://absp2.cornell.edu/resources/briefs/documents/warp_briefs_eng_scr.pdf | archivedate=26 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fertilizer ==
One of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period, the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter. Yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue, which can take a few months to several years to decompose, depending on the crop's C to N ratio and the local environment.

==History==
{{Main|History of agricultural science}}

In the 18th century, [[Johann Friedrich Mayer (agriculturist)|Johann Friedrich Mayer]] conducted experiments on the use of [[gypsum]] (hydrated [[calcium sulphate]]) as a fertilizer.&lt;ref name=&quot;JB 1840&quot;&gt;John Armstrong, Jesse Buel. ''A Treatise on Agriculture, The Present Condition of the Art Abroad and at Home, and the Theory and Practice of Husbandry.

In 1843, [[John Lawes]] and [[Joseph Henry Gilbert]] began a set of long-term field experiments at [[Rothamsted Research Station]] in England, some of which are still running as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Long Term Experiments|url=https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/long-term-experiments|publisher=Rothamsted Research|accessdate=26 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327084207/https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/long-term-experiments|archivedate=27 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the [[Hatch Act of 1887]], which used the term &quot;agricultural science&quot;. The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.&lt;ref&gt;Hillison J. (1996).

Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[Developing country|developing countries]], often referred to as the [[Green Revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s.

As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to [[food industry|food production]] as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.

New technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[history of agriculture|traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[Religion and Agriculture|religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.--&gt;

Because of its purpose, the alchemists' quest is always strictly linked to the religious doctrine of redemption current in each civilization where alchemy is practiced.&lt;br/&gt; In the Western world alchemy presented itself at its advent as a sacred art. But when, after a long detour via Byzantium and Islamic culture, it came back again to Europe in the twelfth century, adepts designated themselves philosophers.

Islamic and European alchemists developed a structure of basic [[laboratory techniques]], theory, terminology, and [[experimental method]], some of which are still in use today. However, they continued [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]'s belief in [[four elements]] and guarded their work in secrecy including [[History of cryptography|cyphers]] and cryptic symbolism. Their work was guided by [[Hermeticism|Hermetic principles]] related to [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[mythology]], and [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Wouter J.

Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its [[exoteric]] practical applications and its [[esoteric]] spiritual aspects, despite the arguments of scholars like [[Eric John Holmyard|Holmyard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marie-Louise von Franz|von Franz]]&lt;ref name=&quot;FRAALC97&quot;&gt;{{harvp|von Franz|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that they should be understood as complementary. The former is pursued by [[History of the physical sciences|historians of the physical sciences]] who examine the subject in terms of [[History of chemistry|early chemistry]], [[History of medicine|medicine]], and [[charlatanism]], and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred. The latter interests historians of [[esotericism]], [[History of psychology|psychologists]], and some philosophers and [[Spirituality|spiritualists]]. The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts. Despite this split, which von Franz believes has existed since the Western traditions' origin in a mix of [[Greek philosophy]] that was mixed with [[Ancient Egyptian technology|Egyptian]] and [[Mesopotamian science|Mesopotamian technology]],&lt;ref name=&quot;FRAALC97&quot; /&gt; numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as [[Pseudo-Democritus]]'s first-century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|ad}} ''On Physical and Mystical Matters'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Physika kai Mystika}}).&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Martelli, ''The Four Books of Pseudo-Democritus'' (Maney, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although alchemy is popularly associated with magic, historian [[Lawrence M. Principe]] argues that recent historical research has revealed that medieval and early modern alchemy embraced a much more diverse set of ideas, goals, techniques, and practices: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Most readers probably are aware of several common claims about alchemy—for example, ... that it is akin to magic, or that its practice then or now is essentially deceptive. These ideas about alchemy emerged during the eighteenth century or after. While each of them might have limited validity within a narrow context, none of them is an accurate depiction of alchemy in general.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Principe, Lawrence M. The secrets of alchemy. University of Chicago Press, 2012, 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{anchor|Etymology}}

== Etymology ==
{{See also|Etymology of chemistry}}
The word alchemy comes from [[Old French]] ''alquemie'', ''alkimie'', used in [[Medieval Latin]] as ''alchymia''. This name was itself brought from the [[Arabic]] word ''al-kīmiyā'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|الكيمياء}} or {{rtl-lang|ar|الخيمياء}}) composed of two parts: the [[Late Greek]] term ''khēmeía'' (χημεία), also spelled ''khumeia'' (χυμεία) and ''khēmía'' (χημία), and the Arabic [[definite article]] ''[[al-]]''  ({{rtl-lang|ar|الـ}}), meaning 'The'.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;{{OED|alchemy}} Or see {{OEtymD|alchemy|accessdate=7 April 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Together this association can be interpreted as 'the process of [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|transmutation]] by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form'. Several etymologies have been proposed for the Greek term. The first was proposed by Zosimos of Panopolis (3rd–4th cent. CE), who derived it from the name of a book, the ''Khemeu.''&lt;ref&gt;George Syncellus, ''Chronography'', 18–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the ancient definitions of alchemy in ancient Greek and Syriac texts see Matteo Martelli. 2014. &quot;The Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy and the Enochian Tradition,&quot; In: Dupré S. (eds) ''Laboratories of Art'', Springer, Cham.&lt;/ref&gt; Hermanm Diels argued in 1914 that it rather derived from χύμα,&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Diels, ''Antike Technik'', Leipzig: Teubner, 1914, p. 108-109. [[iarchive:bub gb LoEAAAAAMAAJ/page/n125/mode/2up|Read online]]&lt;/ref&gt; used to describe metallic objects formed by casting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=xeiw&amp;la=greek#lexicon|title=Greek Word Study Tool|website=perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=14 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others trace its roots to the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name  ''kēme'' (hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 ''khmi'' ), meaning 'black earth' which refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the Nile valley, as opposed to red desert sand.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot; /&gt; According to the Egyptologist [[Wallis Budge]], the Arabic word ''al-kīmiyaʾ'' actually means &quot;the Egyptian [science]&quot;, borrowing from the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] word for &quot;Egypt&quot;, ''kēme'' (or its equivalent in the Mediaeval [[Bohairic]] dialect of Coptic, ''khēme''). This Coptic word derives from [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] ''kmỉ'', itself from ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''kmt''. The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour &quot;black&quot; (Egypt was the &quot;Black Land&quot;, by contrast with the &quot;Red Land&quot;, the surrounding desert); so this etymology could also explain the nickname &quot;Egyptian black arts&quot;.

== History ==
Alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents. These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and &quot;genetic&quot; relationships. One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be mostly independent, at least in their earlier stages: [[Chinese alchemy]], centered in China and [[Rasayana|Indian alchemy]], centered on the [[Indian subcontinent]]; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and whose center has shifted over the millennia from [[Egypt (Roman province)|Greco-Roman Egypt]] to the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], and finally [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]]. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoism]] and Indian alchemy with the [[Indian religions|Dharmic faiths]]. In contrast, Western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various [[Western religion]]s. It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.

=== Hellenistic Egypt ===
[[File:Zosimosapparat.jpg|thumb|300px|Ambix, cucurbit and retort of [[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimos]], from [[Marcelin Berthelot]], ''Collection des anciens alchimistes grecs'' (3 vol., Paris, 1887–1888).]]

The start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and [[Hellenistic Egypt]], where the city of [[Alexandria]] was a center of alchemical knowledge, and retained its pre-eminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods.&lt;ref&gt;''New Scientist'', 24–31 December 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Following the work of André-Jean Festugière, modern scholars see alchemical practice in the Roman Empire as originating from the Egyptian goldsmith's art, Greek philosophy and different religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Festugière|first=André-Jean|title=La révélation d'Hermès Trismégiste, Vol.1|publisher=Les Belles Lettres|year=2006|location=Paris|pages=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracing the origins of the alchemical art in Egypt is complicated by the [[pseudepigraphic]] nature of texts from the Greek alchemical corpus. The treatises of [[Zosimos of Panopolis]], the earliest, historically-attested author (fl. c. 300 CE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martelli |first1=Matteo |title=L'alchimista antico |date=2019 |publisher=Editrice Bibliografica |isbn=9788870759792 |pages=73–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; can however help in situating the other authors. Zosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors, such as [[Mary the Jewess]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book|last=Patai|first=Raphael|title=The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LorvA_5Ex_UC&amp;pg=PA60|year=1995|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691006420|pages=60–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pseudo-Democritus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Martelli, The Four Books of Pseudo-Democritus&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martelli |first1=Matteo |title=The Four Books of Pseudo-Democritus |date=2014 |publisher=Maney |location=Leeds}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Agathodaimon]], but very little is known about any of these authors. The most complete of their works, The ''Four Books'' of [[Pseudo-Democritus]], were probably written in the first century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martelli, The Four Books of Pseudo-Democritus&quot;/&gt;

Recent scholarship tend to emphasizes the testimony of Zosimus, who traced the alchemical arts back to Egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martelli |first1=Matteo |title=L'alchimista antico |date=2019 |publisher=Editrice Bibliografica |isbn=9788870759792}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grimes|first=Shannon|url=https://rubedo.press/becoming-gold|title=Becoming Gold|publisher=Rubedo Press|year=2018|location=Auckland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dufault |first1=Olivier |title=Early Greek Alchemy, Patronage and Innovation in Late Antiquity |date=2019 |publisher=California Classical Studies |location=Berkeley |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2ks0g83x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that early alchemical writers borrowed the vocabulary of Greek philosophical schools but did not implement any of its doctrines in a systematic way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dufault |first1=Olivier |s2cid=10823051 |title=Transmutation Theory in the Greek Alchemical Corpus |journal=Ambix |year=2015 |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=215–244 |doi=10.1179/1745823415Y.0000000003|pmid=26307909 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimos of Panopolis wrote in the ''Final Abstinence'' (also known as the &quot;Final Count&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;The title of the τελευταὶα ἀποχή is traditionally translated as the &quot;Final Count&quot;. Considering that the treatise does not mention any count nor counting and that it makes a case against the use of sacrifice in the practice of alchemy, a preferable translation would be &quot;the Final Abstinence&quot;.

Since Zosimos also called the demons &quot;gardians of places&quot; (οἱ κατὰ τόπον ἔφοροι) and those who offered them sacrifices &quot;priests&quot; (ἱερέα), it is fairly clear that he was referring to the gods of Egypt and their priests.

'''Mythology''' – Zosimos of Panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic Egypt]] where it was the domain of the priestly class, though there is little to no evidence for his assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garfinkel|first=Harold|title=Ethnomethodological Studies of Work|publisher=Routledge &amp;Kegan Paul|year=1986|pages=127|isbn=978-0-415-11965-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy. 'Roman and European Mythologies'. University of Chicago Press, 1992. pp. 211–213&lt;/ref&gt; These included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets, [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Jason]], and many others.

The central figure in the mythology of alchemy is [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (or Thrice-Great Hermes). His name is derived from the [[deity|god]] [[Thoth]] and his Greek counterpart [[Hermes]]. Hermes and his [[caduceus]] or serpent-staff, were among alchemy's principal symbols. According to [[Clement of Alexandria]], he wrote what were called the &quot;forty-two books of Hermes&quot;, covering all fields of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book VI/Chapter IV.|Clement, ''Stromata'', vi. 4.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Hermetica]]'' of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the [[hermeticism|hermetic philosophy]] by its early practitioners. These writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era.

'''Philosophy''' – Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of [[Pythagoreanism]], [[Platonism]], [[Stoicism]] and [[Gnosticism]] which formed the origin of alchemy's character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chemistry, Bensaude-Vincent 1996, p13&quot; /&gt; An important example of alchemy's roots in Greek philosophy, originated by [[Empedocles]] and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]]. According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lindsay, Jack | title=The Origins of Alchemy in Graeco-Roman Egypt | location=London | publisher=Muller | year=1970 | isbn=978-0-389-01006-7 | page=[https://archive.org/details/trent_0116301348557/page/16 16] | url=https://archive.org/details/trent_0116301348557/page/16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are; &quot;...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word.

Alchemy coexisted alongside emerging [[Christianity]]. [[Lactantius]] believed Hermes Trismegistus had prophesied its birth. [[Augustine of Hippo|St&amp;nbsp;Augustine]] later affirmed this in the 4th &amp; 5th centuries, but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;Fanning, Philip Ashley. ''Isaac Newton and the Transmutation of Alchemy: An Alternative View of the Scientific Revolution.'' 2009. p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Pagan, Christian, and Jewish alchemists can be found during this period.

Most of the Greco-Roman alchemists preceding Zosimos are known only by pseudonyms, such as [[Moses of Alexandria|Moses]], Isis, [[Cleopatra the Alchemist|Cleopatra]], [[Pseudo-Democritus|Democritus]], and [[Ostanes]]. Others authors such as Komarios, and [[Chymes]], we only know through fragments of text.

The 11th-century [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Persian chemist]] and [[Medicine in medieval Islam|physician]] [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]], who visited Gujarat as part of the court of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], reported that they
{{bquote|have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them, which in [[Sanskrit]] is called [[Rasayāna]] and in Persian [[Rasavātam]]. It means the art of obtaining/manipulating ''Rasa'': nectar, mercury, and juice. This art was restricted to certain operations, metals, drugs, compounds, and medicines, many of which have mercury as their core element. Its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age.}}
The goals of alchemy in India included the creation of a divine body (Sanskrit ''divya-deham'') and immortality while still embodied (Sanskrit ''jīvan-mukti'').  Sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur, that are homologized with the semen of the god Śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess Devī.

Some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of [[Matsyendranath]].  Other early writings are found in the Jaina medical treatise ''Kalyāṇakārakam'' of Ugrāditya, written in South India in the early 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meulenbeld|first1=G.

Two famous early Indian alchemical authors were [[Nagarjuna (metallurgist)|Nāgārjuna Siddha]] and Nityanātha Siddha. Nāgārjuna Siddha was a Buddhist monk. His book, ''Rasendramangalam'', is an example of Indian alchemy and medicine. Nityanātha Siddha wrote ''Rasaratnākara'', also a highly influential work. In Sanskrit, ''rasa'' translates to &quot;mercury&quot;, and Nāgārjuna Siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://univie.academia.edu/DominikWujastyk/Papers/152766/ |last=Wujastyk |first=Dominik |year=1984 |title=An Alchemical Ghost: The Rasaratnākara of Nāgarjuna |journal=Ambix |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=70–83|doi=10.1179/amb.1984.31.2.70 |pmid=11615977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jabir ibn Hayyan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jābir ibn Hayyān|Jabir ibn Hayyan]] (Geber), considered the &quot;father of [[chemistry]]&quot;, introduced a [[Scientific method|scientific]] and [[experiment]]al approach to alchemy.]]

After [[the Fall of the Roman Empire]], the focus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World. Much more is known about [[Islam]]ic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=46 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''alchemy'' itself was derived from the Arabic word ''al-kīmiyā'' (الكيمياء). The early Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy. [[Plato]]nic and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translations and scholarship.

In the late 8th century, [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Latinized as &quot;Geber&quot; or &quot;Geberus&quot;) introduced a new approach to alchemy, based on [[scientific method]]ology and controlled [[experiment]]ation in the [[laboratory]], in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible, with very little concern for laboratory work.&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; Jabir is thus &quot;considered by many to be the father of [[chemistry]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Zygmunt S.|last=Derewenda|year=2007|title=On wine, chirality and crystallography|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section A|volume=64|issue=Pt 1|pages=246–258 [247]|doi=10.1107/S0108767307054293|pmid=18156689|bibcode = 2008AcCrA..64..246D |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit others reserve that title for [[Robert Boyle]] or [[Antoine Lavoisier]]. The science historian, Paul Kraus, wrote:

{{quote|To form an idea of the historical place of Jabir's alchemy and to tackle the problem of its sources, it is advisable to compare it with what remains to us of the alchemical literature in the [[Greek language]]. One knows in which miserable state this literature reached us. Collected by [[Byzantine science|Byzantine scientists]] from the tenth century, the corpus of the Greek alchemists is a cluster of incoherent fragments, going back to all the times since the third century until the end of the Middle Ages.

The efforts of Berthelot and Ruelle to put a little order in this mass of literature led only to poor results, and the later researchers, among them in particular Mrs. Hammer-Jensen, Tannery, Lagercrantz, von Lippmann, Reitzenstein, Ruska, Bidez, Festugiere and others, could make clear only few points of detail ....

The study of the Greek alchemists is not very encouraging. An even surface examination of the Greek texts shows that a very small part only was organized according to true experiments of laboratory: even the supposedly technical writings, in the state where we find them today, are unintelligible nonsense which refuses any interpretation.

It is different with Jabir's alchemy. The relatively clear description of the processes and the alchemical apparati, the methodical classification of the substances, mark an experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird and odd esotericism of the Greek texts. The theory on which Jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an impressive unity. More than with the other Arab authors, one notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and practical teaching, between the ''[[Ilm (Arabic)|'ilm]]'' and the ''amal''. In vain one would seek in the Greek texts a work as systematic as that which is presented, for example, in the ''Book of Seventy''.&lt;ref name=Kraus&gt;Kraus, Paul, Jâbir ibn Hayyân, ''Contribution à l'histoire des idées scientifiques dans l'Islam. I. Le corpus des écrits jâbiriens. II. Jâbir et la science grecque,''. Cairo (1942–1943). Repr. By Fuat Sezgin, (Natural Sciences in Islam. 67–68), Frankfurt. 2002:

Jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation:

{{bquote|The first essential in chemistry is that thou shouldest perform practical work and conduct experiments,&lt;br /&gt; for he who performs not practical work nor makes experiments will never attain to the least degree of mastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1931|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early Islamic chemists such as [[Jābir ibn Hayyān|Jabir Ibn Hayyan]], [[Al-Kindi]] (&quot;Alkindus&quot;) and [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Muhammad ibn Zakarīya al-Rāzi]] (&quot;Rasis&quot; or &quot;Rhazes&quot;) contributed a number of key chemical discoveries, such as the muriatic ([[hydrochloric acid]]), [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]]s, and more. The discovery that [[aqua regia]], a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids, could dissolve the noblest metal, gold, was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium.

Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism. The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir. Jabir's ultimate goal was ''[[Takwin]]'', the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to, and including, human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of ''hotness'', ''coldness'', ''dryness'', and ''moistness''.&lt;ref name=burckhardt29 /&gt; According to Jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result.&lt;ref name=burckhardt29&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=29 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this reasoning, the search for the [[philosopher's stone]] was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate [[numerology]] whereby the root letters of a substance's name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element's physical properties.

The elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir. His original system consisted of seven elements, which included the five [[classical element]]s ([[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], and [[Water (classical element)|water]]) in addition to two [[chemical element]]s representing the metals: [[Sulfur|sulphur]], &quot;the stone which burns&quot;, which characterized the principle of combustibility, and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties. Shortly thereafter, this evolved into eight elements, with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles: sulphur giving flammability or combustion, mercury giving volatility and stability, and [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] giving solidity.&lt;ref name=&quot;r8&quot;&gt;Strathern, Paul. (2000), ''Mendeleyev's Dream – the Quest for the Elements'', New York: [[Berkley Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[atomic theory]] of [[corpuscularianism]], where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles, also has its origins in the work of Jabir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Distilling knowledge: alchemy, chemistry, and the scientific revolution|first=Bruce T.|last=Moran|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-674-01495-4|page=146|quote=a corpuscularian tradition in alchemy stemming from the speculations of the medieval author Geber (Jabir ibn Hayyan)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 9th to 14th centuries, alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical Muslim chemists, including [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]],&lt;ref&gt;Felix Klein-Frank (2001), &quot;Al-Kindi&quot;, in [[Oliver Leaman]] &amp; [[Hossein Nasr]], ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 174.

Whereas European alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals, Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine. The philosopher's stone of European alchemists can be compared to the [[Elixir of life|Grand Elixir of Immortality]] sought by Chinese alchemists. However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher's stone was often equated with the [[Panacea (medicine)|universal panacea]]; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears.

[[Black powder]] may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists. As previously stated above, [[China|Chinese]] alchemy was more related to medicine. It is said that the Chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a [[potion]] for eternal life. Described in 9th-century texts{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} and used in [[fireworks]] in China by the 10th century,{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} it was used in [[cannon]]s by 1290.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} From China, the use of [[gunpowder]] spread to Japan, the [[Mongol]]s, the Muslim world, and Europe. Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe by the 14th century.

Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoist]] forms of [[traditional Chinese medicine]], such as [[Acupuncture]] and [[Moxibustion]]. In the early [[Song dynasty]], followers of this Taoist idea (chiefly the elite and upper class) would ingest [[cinnabar|mercuric sulfide]], which, though tolerable in low levels, led many to suicide.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Taoist heavens, the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} (the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan,{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} mastering of the [[qi]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} etc.)

The introduction of alchemy to Latin Europe may be dated to 11 February 1144, with the completion of [[Robert of Chester]]'s translation of the Arabic ''Book of the Composition of Alchemy''. Although European craftsmen and technicians preexisted, Robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in Latin Europe at the time of his writing. The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century [[Toledo, Spain]], through contributors like [[Gerard of Cremona]] and [[Adelard of Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of the time included the [[Turba Philosophorum]], and the works of [[Avicenna]] and [[al-Razi]]. These brought with them many new words to the European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent. Alcohol, carboy, elixir, and athanor are examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism, thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought. The 11th-century [[Anselm of Canterbury|St&amp;nbsp;Anselm]] put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context. In the early 12th century, [[Peter Abelard]] followed Anselm's work, laying down the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West. In the early 13th century, [[Robert Grosseteste]] used Abelard's methods of analysis and added the use of observation, experimentation, and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations. Grosseteste also did much work to reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking.&lt;ref name=hollister294f&gt;{{cite book | author=Hollister, C.

Through much of the 12th and 13th centuries, alchemical knowledge in Europe remained centered on translations, and new Latin contributions were not made. The efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists. In the 13th century, [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Roger Bacon]] were the most notable of these, their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms.&lt;ref&gt;John Read. ''From Alchemy to Chemistry''. 1995 p.90&lt;/ref&gt; Albertus Magnus, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]], is known to have written works such as the ''Book of Minerals'' where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes and Democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time. Albertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and Avicenna, where they concerned the transmutation of metals. From the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century, more than 28 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him, a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Weisheipl. ''Albertus Magnus and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays.'' PIMS. 1980. p.187-202&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, alchemical texts have been attributed to Albert's student [[Thomas Aquinas]].

Roger Bacon, a [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan friar]] who wrote on a wide variety of topics including [[optics]], [[comparative linguistics]], and medicine, composed his ''[[Opus Majus|Great Work]]'' ({{lang-la|Opus Majus}}) for {{nowrap|[[Pope Clement IV]]}} as part of a project towards rebuilding the [[medieval university]] curriculum to include the new learning of his time. While alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic, he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy's connections to [[soteriology]] and Christian theology. Bacon's writings integrated morality, salvation, alchemy, and the prolongation of life. His correspondence with Clement highlighted this, noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Brehm. &quot;Roger Bacon's Place in the History of Alchemy.&quot; ''Ambix.'' Vol. 23, Part I, March 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Greeks before him, Bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres. He noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle, the natural philosophers, and all Latin writers of his time. The practical, however, confirmed the theoretical thought experiment, and Bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later European legend, however, Bacon became an archmage. In particular, along with Albertus Magnus, he was credited with the forging of a [[brazen head]] capable of answering its owner's questions.

Soon after Bacon, the influential work of [[Pseudo-Geber]] (sometimes identified as [[Paul of Taranto]]) appeared. His ''Summa Perfectionis'' remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity with which they were described.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=134–141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the [[soul|human soul]]). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded [[jargon]] set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made [[observation]]s and [[theory|theories]] about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=149 | others=Trans.

In the 14th century, alchemy became more accessible to Europeans outside the confines of Latin speaking churchmen and scholars. Alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' University of Chicago Press, 2007. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante]], [[Piers Plowman]], and [[Chaucer]] all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars. [[Pope John XXII]]'s 1317 edict, ''[[Spondent quas non-exhibent]]'' forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo-alchemists.&lt;ref&gt;John Hines, II, R. F. Yeager. ''John Gower, Trilingual Poet: Language, Translation, and Tradition.'' Boydell &amp; Brewer. 2010. p.170&lt;/ref&gt; In 1403, Henry IV of England banned the practice of multiplying metals (although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically, and a number were granted by Henry VI and Edward IV&lt;ref&gt;D. Geoghegan, &quot;A licence of Henry VI to practise Alchemy&quot; Ambix, volume 6, 1957, pages 10–17&lt;/ref&gt;). These critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo-alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy, which continued with an increasingly Christian tone. The 14th century saw the Christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of [[Petrus Bonus]], [[John of Rupescissa]], and in works written in the name of Raymond Lull and Arnold of Villanova.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leah DeVun]]. ''From Prophecy, Alchemy, and the End of Time: John of Rupescissa in the late Middle Ages.'' Columbia University Press, 2009. p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolas Flamel]] is a well-known alchemist, but a good example of [[pseudepigraphy]], the practice of giving your works the name of someone else, usually more famous. Although the historical Flamel existed, the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|2003|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Nicolas Flamel. Des Livres et de l'or&quot; by Nigel Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; Flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the [[philosopher's stone]]. His work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of 'his' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosopher's stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | pages=170–181 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the [[late Middle Ages|14th and 15th centuries]], alchemists were much like Flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers' stone. [[Bernard Trevisan]] and [[George Ripley (alchemist)|George Ripley]] made similar contributions. Their cryptic allusions and [[symbol]]ism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.

During the [[Renaissance]], Hermetic and Platonic foundations were restored to European alchemy. The dawn of medical, pharmaceutical, occult, and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed.

In the late 15th century, [[Marsilo Ficino]] translated the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] and the works of Plato into Latin. These were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent. [[Renaissance Humanism]] and [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]] guided alchemists away from [[physics]] to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel.

Esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism, fusing it with magic, astrology, and Christian cabala.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Forshaw. '&quot;Chemistry, That Starry Science&quot; – Early Modern Conjunctions of Astrology and Alchemy' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Forshaw, 'Cabala Chymica or Chemia Cabalistica – Early Modern Alchemists and Cabala' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; A key figure in this development was German [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486–1535), who received his Hermetic education in Italy in the schools of the humanists. In his ''De Occulta Philosophia'', he attempted to merge [[Kabbalah]], Hermeticism, and alchemy. He was instrumental in spreading this new blend of Hermeticism outside the borders of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Alexander Magee. ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition.'' Cornell University Press. 2008. p.30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. ''The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction.'' Oxford University Press. 2008 p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippus Aureolus [[Paracelsus]], (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541) cast alchemy into a new form, rejecting some of Agrippa's occultism and moving away from [[chrysopoeia]]. Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote, &quot;Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Edwardes, Michael | title=The Dark Side of History | location=New York | publisher=Stein and Day | year=1977 | page=47 | isbn=978-0-552-11463-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm. He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Debus, Allen G. |author2=Multhauf, Robert P. | title=Alchemy and Chemistry in the Seventeenth Century | location=Los Angeles | publisher=William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, University of California. | year=1966 | pages=6–12 |author-link=Debus, Allen G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paracelsian practical alchemy, especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named [[spagyric]] (a synonym for alchemy from the Greek words meaning ''to separate'' and ''to join together'', based on the Latin alchemic maxim: ''solve et coagula'').&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham. ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 5, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Physiological Alchemy.'' Cambridge University Press. P.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iatrochemistry]] also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by Paracelsus.

[[John Dee]] (13 July 1527 – December, 1608) followed Agrippa's occult tradition. Although better known for angel summoning, divination, and his role as [[astrologer]], cryptographer, and consultant to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], Dee's alchemical&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Monas hieroglyphica'' is not a traditional alchemical work, but has important theoretical insights about a cosmic vision, in which alchemy played an important part.&quot;{{cite web | last = Szőnyi| first = György E.| year = 2015 | url = http://www.renesancni-texty.upol.cz/soubory/publikace/Latin_Alchemical_Literature_of_Czech_Provenance.pdf | title = 'Layers of Meaning in Alchemy in John Dee's Monas hieroglyphica and its Relevance in a Central European Context'| publisher =  Centre for Renaissance Texts, 2015, 118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Monas Hieroglyphica'', written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work.

''Secrets of Nature: Astrology and Alchemy in Early Modern Europe''. MIT Press, 2001. P.173.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, a short-lived &quot;supernatural&quot; interpretation of alchemy became popular, including support by fellows of the [[Royal Society]]: [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Elias Ashmole]]. Proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher's stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels.&lt;ref&gt;* ''Journal of the History of Ideas, 41'', 1980, '''p. 293-318'''

Entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of Renaissance Europe. Alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining, medical services, and the production of chemicals, medicines, metals, and gemstones.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the late 16th century, famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague, including Dee and his associate [[Edward Kelley]]. [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV of Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. iii, (1901), 99, 202, 206, 209, 330, 340, 341, 353, 355, 365, 379, 382, 389, 409.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], [[Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]], [[Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn]], and [[Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]] all contracted alchemists.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.85-98&lt;/ref&gt; John's son [[Arthur Dee]] worked as a court physician to [[Michael I of Russia]] and [[Charles I of England]] but also compiled the alchemical book ''[[Fasciculus Chemicus]]''.

Although most of these appointments were legitimate, the trend of pseudo-alchemical fraud continued through the Renaissance. ''Betrüger'' would use sleight of hand, or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage. Legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as [[Michael Maier]] and [[Heinrich Khunrath]] wrote about fraudulent transmutations, distinguishing themselves from the [[con artist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.171&lt;/ref&gt; False alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud.

The terms &quot;chemia&quot; and &quot;alchemia&quot; were used as synonyms in the early modern period, and the differences between alchemy, chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day. There were important overlaps between practitioners, and trying to classify them into alchemists, chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic. For example, [[Tycho Brahe]] (1546–1601), an alchemist better known for his [[astronomical]] and [[astrological]] investigations, had a laboratory built at his [[Uraniborg]] observatory/research institute. [[Michał Sędziwój|Michael Sendivogius]] (''Michał Sędziwój'', 1566–1636), a [[Poland|Polish]] alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling [[oxygen]] in a lab sometime around 1600. Sendivogious taught his technique to [[Cornelius Drebbel]] who, in 1621, applied this in a submarine. [[Isaac Newton]] devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]) than he did to either optics or physics. Other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]]. Their Hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science.

=== Later modern period ===
[[File:The Shannon Portrait of the Hon Robert Boyle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Boyle]]]]
[[File:Alchemist.png|thumb|right|An alchemist, pictured in Charles Mackay's ''[[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds]]''.]]
The decline of European alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for &quot;ancient wisdom&quot;. Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its peak in the 18th century. As late as 1781 [[James Price (chemist)|James Price]] claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold. Early modern European alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories, practices, and purposes: &quot;Scholastic and anti-Aristotelian, Paracelsian and anti-Paracelsian, Hermetic, Neoplatonic, mechanistic, vitalistic, and more—plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alchemy Restored&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Principe | first1 = Lawrence M | year = 2011 | title = Alchemy Restored | journal = Isis | volume = 102 | issue = 2| pages = 305–12 | doi = 10.1086/660139 | pmid = 21874690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations. He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data. Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Pilkington, Roger | title=Robert Boyle: Father of Chemistry | location=London | publisher=John Murray | year=1959 | page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]] and [[John Dalton]].

Beginning around 1720, a rigid distinction began to be drawn for the first time between &quot;alchemy&quot; and &quot;chemistry&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewmanPrincipe2002p37&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Newman|Principe|2002|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp386&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1740s, &quot;alchemy&quot; was now restricted to the realm of gold making, leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans, and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alchemy Restored&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp386&quot; /&gt; In order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure to which alchemy was being subjected, academic writers during the 18th-century scientific Enlightenment attempted, for the sake of survival, to divorce and separate the &quot;new&quot; chemistry from the &quot;old&quot; practices of alchemy. This move was mostly successful, and the consequences of this continued into the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanpp386–7&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|pp=386–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the occult revival of the early 19th century, alchemy received new attention as an occult science.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp387&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KripalShuck2005p27&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kripal|Shuck|2005|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The esoteric or occultist school, which arose during the 19th century, held (and continues to hold) the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewmanPrincipe2002p37&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eliade|1994|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp388&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination, as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals, and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual, moral or mystical processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp388&quot; /&gt;

In the 19th-century revival of alchemy, the two most seminal figures were [[Mary Anne Atwood]] and [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (general)|Ethan Allen Hitchcock]], who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy. Both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy, as Atwood claimed: &quot;No modern art or chemistry, notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims, has any thing in common with Alchemy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PrincipeNewmanp391&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rutkin2001p143&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rutkin|2001|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atwood's work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including [[Eliphas Levi]], [[Arthur Edward Waite]], and [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Hitchcock, in his ''Remarks Upon Alchymists'' (1855) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state. In 1845, Baron [[Carl Reichenbach]], published his studies on [[Odic force]], a concept with some similarities to alchemy, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Merkur. ''Gnosis: An Esoteric Tradition of Mystical Visions and Unions.'' SUNY Press. 1993 p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[Louis Cattiaux]] published the Message Retrouvé, a work that was at once philosophical, mystical and highly influenced by alchemy. In his lineage, many researchers, including Emmanuel and Charles d'Hooghvorst, are updating alchemical studies in France and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Croire l'Incroyable.

=== Women in alchemy ===

Several women appear in the earliest history of alchemy. [[Michael Maier]] names [[Mary the Jewess]], [[Cleopatra the Alchemist]], [[Medera]], and [[Paphnutia the Virgin|Taphnutia]] as the four women who knew how to make the philosopher's stone.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patai. ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book.'' p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimos' sister Theosebia (later known as Euthica the Arab) and [[Isis the Prophetess]] also played a role in early alchemical texts.

The first alchemist whose name we know is said to have been Mary the Jewess (c. 200 A.D.).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in Chemistry: Their Changing Roles from Alchemical Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century|author1=Rayner-Canham, M|author2=Rayner-Canham, G|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|year=2005|isbn=9780941901277|pages=[https://archive.org/details/womeninchemistry0000rayn/page/2 2–4]|url=https://archive.org/details/womeninchemistry0000rayn/page/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early sources claim that Mary (or Maria) devised a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Her best known advances were in heating and distillation processes. The laboratory water-bath, known eponymously (especially in France) as the [[bain-marie]], is said to have been invented or at least improved by her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book|last=Patai|first=R|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780691006420|pages=60–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially a double-boiler, it was (and is) used in chemistry for processes that require gentle heating.

Due to the proliferation of [[pseudepigrapha]] and anonymous works, it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women. After the Greco-Roman period, women's names appear less frequently in the alchemical literature. Women vacate the history of alchemy during the medieval and renaissance periods, aside from the fictitious account of [[Perenelle Flamel]]. [[Mary Anne Atwood]]'s ''A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery'' (1850) marks their return during the nineteenth-century occult revival.

''Western esotericism and the science of religion.'' 1995. p.viii–xvi&lt;/ref&gt; As the language of the alchemists is analyzed, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the evolution of science and [[philosophy]], the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, [[Kabbalah|kabbalism]], [[spiritualism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and other mystic movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://centres.exeter.ac.uk/exeseso/|title=Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism.

A large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the [[Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica]] in Amsterdam. A recipe found in a mid-19th-century kabbalah based book features step by step instructions on turning copper into gold. The author attributed this recipe to an ancient manuscript he located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishnews.com/2015/09/27/old-jewish-book-outlines-how-to-turn-copper-into-gold|title=Old Jewish Book Outlines how to Turn Copper into Gold|access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born. Concepts were imported from [[Neoplatonism]] and earlier Greek [[cosmology]]. As such, the [[Classical elements]] appear in alchemical writings, as do the seven [[Classical planets]] and the corresponding seven [[metals of antiquity]]. Similarly, the gods of the Roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature. The concepts of [[prima materia]] and [[anima mundi]] are central to the theory of the [[philosopher's stone]].

=== Hermeticism ===
{{Hermeticism}}
In the eyes of a variety of esoteric and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] practitioners, alchemy is fundamentally spiritual. Transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation, purification, and perfection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antoine Faivre 1995. p.96&quot;&gt;Antoine Faivre, Wouter J. Hanegraaff. ''Western esotericism and the science of religion.'' 1995. p.96&lt;/ref&gt; The writings attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]] are a primary source of alchemical theory. He is named &quot;alchemy's founder and chief patron, authority, inspiration and guide&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|2003|pp=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early alchemists, such as [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] (c. AD 300), highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest, symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul.&lt;ref&gt;Allen G. Debus. ''Alchemy and early modern chemistry.'' The Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry. p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach continued in the Middle Ages, as metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and material processes were used as metaphors for [[spirit]]ual entities, spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformation. In this sense, the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas' were a blind, hiding their true [[spiritual philosophy]]. Practitioners and patrons such as [[Melchior Cibinensis]] and [[Pope Innocent VIII]] existed within the ranks of the church, while [[Martin Luther]] applauded alchemy for its consistency with Christian teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patai. ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book.'' Princeton University Press. p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state toward a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state, so the philosopher's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning.

In his 1766 ''Alchemical Catechism'', Théodore Henri de Tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver?
A. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the Philosophers are full of life.&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Henri de Tschudi. Hermetic Catechism in his ''L'Etoile Flamboyant ou la Société des Franc-Maçons considerée sous tous les aspects.'' 1766.  (A.E. Waite translation as found in ''The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus.'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

=== Magnum opus ===
{{Main|Magnum opus (alchemy)}}
The Great Work of Alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors.

*''[[nigredo]]'', a blackening or melanosis
*''[[Albedo (alchemy)|albedo]]'', a whitening or leucosis
*''[[citrinitas]]'', a yellowing or xanthosis
*''[[rubedo]]'', a reddening, purpling, or iosis&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham. ''Science &amp; Civilisation in China: Chemistry and chemical technology. Spagyrical discovery and invention: magisteries of gold and immortality.'' Cambridge. 1974. p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern alchemy ==
Due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry; the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those focusing on the exoteric, such as historians of science [[Lawrence M. Principe]] and [[William R. Newman]], have interpreted the 'decknamen' (or code words) of alchemy as physical substances. These scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Conniff. &quot;Alchemy May Not Have Been the Pseudoscience We All Thought It Was.&quot; [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/alchemy-may-not-been-pseudoscience-we-thought-it-was-180949430/ Smithsonian Magazine.] February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the opposite end of the spectrum, focusing on the esoteric, scholars, such as George Calian&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last= Calian |first= George |title= Alkimia Operativa and Alkimia Speculativa. Some Modern Controversies on the Historiography of Alchemy |publisher= Annual of Medieval Studies at CEU |year= 2010 |url= https://archive.org/stream/AlkimiaOperativaAndAlkimiaSpeculativa.SomeModernControversiesOnThe/FlorinGeorgeCalian-AlkimiaOperativaAndAlkimiaSpeculativa.SomeModernControversiesOnTheHistoriographyOfAlchemy#page/n0/mode/2up |ref= harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anna Marie Roos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2013.08.001|title=The experimental approach towards a historiography of alchemy (reviewing L. M. Principe, the Secrets of Alchemy)|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|volume=44|issue=4|pages=787–789|year=2013|last1=Roos|first1=Anna Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt; who question the reading of Principe and Newman, interpret these same decknamen as spiritual, religious, or psychological concepts.

Today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated, sometimes merging in concepts from [[New Age]] or radical environmentalism movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups like the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]] and [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism. Since the Victorian revival of alchemy, &quot;occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice, involving the self-transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Alchemy Restored&quot; /&gt; which has contributed to a merger of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and alchemy in popular thought.

=== Traditional medicine ===
{{Main|Ayurveda|Traditional Chinese medicine}}
Traditional medicine can use the concept of the transmutation of natural substances, using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques. In [[Ayurveda]], the [[Samskara (Ayurvedic)|samskaras]] are claimed to transform [[heavy metals]] and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity. These processes are actively used to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Junius, Manfred M; ''The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy: An Herbalist's Guide to Preparing Medicinal Essences, Tinctures, and Elixirs''; Healing Arts Press 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Spagyrists of the 20th century, [[Frater Albertus|Albert Richard Riedel]] and Jean Dubuis, merged Paracelsian alchemy with occultism, teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods. The schools they founded, ''Les Philosophes de la Nature'' and ''The Paracelsus Research Society'', popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products.&lt;ref&gt;Joscelyn Godwin.  ''The Golden Thread: The Ageless Wisdom of the Western Mystery Traditions.'' Quest Books, 2007. p.120&lt;/ref&gt; The courses, books, organizations, and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a New Age medicinal practice.

=== Psychology ===
Alchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the Swiss psychologist [[Carl Jung|Carl Gustav Jung]]. Initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images, after being given a copy of the translation of ''The Secret of the Golden Flower'', a Chinese alchemical text, by his friend Richard Wilhelm, Jung discovered a direct correlation or parallels between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner, symbolic images coming up in dreams, visions or imaginations during the psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients. A process, which he called &quot;process of individuation&quot;. He regarded the alchemical images as symbols expressing aspects of this &quot;process of [[individuation]]&quot; of which the creation of the gold or lapis within were symbols for its origin and goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung, C. G. 1944&quot;&gt;Jung, C. G. (1944). Psychology and Alchemy (2nd ed. 1968 Collected Works Vol. 12 {{ISBN|0-691-01831-6}}). London: Routledge. E.g. §41, §116, §427, §431, §448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson. ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33&quot;/&gt; Together with his alchemical ''mystica soror'', Jungian Swiss analyst [[Marie-Louise von Franz]], Jung began collecting all the old alchemical texts available, compiled a lexicon of key phrases with cross-references&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Stevens: ''On Jung.'' (A new and authoritiative introduction to Jung's life and thought), Penguin Books, London 1990, {{ISBN|0140124942}}, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; and pored over them. The volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy's popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer, spirit and matter are reunited in the ''[[hieros gamos]]''  or divine marriage. His writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams, symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces ([[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson. ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33&quot;&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson. ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Jung Preface to [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]]'s translation of the [[I Ching]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.-G. Jung Preface to the translation of [[Secret of the Golden Flower|The Secret of The Golden Flower]].&lt;/ref&gt; that influence all of life.

Both von Franz and Jung have contributed greatly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture. Jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is Volume 14 of his Collected Works, ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis|Mysterium Conuinctionis]]''.

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}
Alchemy has had a long-standing relationship with art, seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment. ''Literary alchemy'' appears throughout the history of English literature from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] to [[J. K. Rowling]], and also the popular Japanese manga ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]''. Here, characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus. In the 14th century, Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of [[Terry Pratchett]].

Visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy. While some of them used alchemy as a source of satire, others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work. Music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers. In the last hundred years, alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction, film, television, novels, comics and video games.

=== Modern science ===
One goal of alchemy, synthesizing gold, is now technologically possible, though not financially practical.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} Gold has been synthesized in particle accelerators as early as 1941.

[[File:JohannesVermeer-TheAstronomer(1668).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'', 1668, by [[Johannes Vermeer]]]]

An '''astronomer''' is a [[scientist]] in the field of [[astronomy]] who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of [[Earth]]. They observe [[astronomical object]]s such as [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[comet]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] – in either [[observational astronomy|observational]] (by analyzing the data) or [[theoretical astronomy]]. Examples of topics or fields astronomers study include [[planetary science]], solar astronomy, the origin or [[stellar evolution|evolution of stars]], or the [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]]. Related but distinct subjects like [[physical cosmology]], which studies the [[Universe]] as a whole.

Astronomers usually fall under either of two main types: observational and [[scientific theory|theoretical]]. Observational astronomers make direct [[observation]]s of celestial objects and analyze the data. In contrast, theoretical astronomers create and investigate [[Conceptual model|model]]s of things that cannot be observed. Because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle, astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form, evolve, and die. They use these data to create models or [[simulation]]s to theorize how different celestial objects work.

Further subcategories under these two main [[branches of science|branches]] of astronomy include planetary astronomy, [[galactic astronomy]], or physical cosmology.

[[History of astronomy|Historically]], astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of [[phenomena]] in the sky, while [[astrophysics]] attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws. Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms &quot;astronomer&quot; and &quot;astrophysicist&quot; are interchangeable. Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[physics]] or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Becoming an Astronomer |accessdate=29 March 2009 |publisher=NOAO | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090403101540/http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html| archivedate= 3 April 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory.

The number of professional astronomers in the [[United States]] is actually quite small. The [[American Astronomical Society]], which is the major organization of professional astronomers in [[North America]], has approximately 7,000 members. This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, [[geology]], and [[engineering]], whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aas.org/ |title=American Astronomical Society Home |accessdate=14 August 2009 |publisher=AAS| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090802044012/http://aas.org/|archive-date= 2 August 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/about/ |title=About IAU |accessdate=14 August 2009 |publisher=IAU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a [[telescope]] through the dark hours of the night, it is far more common to use a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the [[light]] is added over time. Before CCDs, [[photographic plates]] were a common method of observation. Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year. Analysis of observed phenomena, along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe, takes the majority of observational astronomers' time.

Astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes. Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes [[planetarium]]s as a public service to encourage interest in the field.

Those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths, sciences and computing in high school. Taking courses that teach how to research, write and present papers are also invaluable. In college/university most astronomers get a PhD in astronomy or physics.

== Amateur astronomers == 
{{main|Amateur astronomy}}
While there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers, the field is popular among [[amateurs]]. Most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host [[star party|star parties]]. The [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astrosociety.org/about.html |title=About Us |accessdate=29 March 2009 |publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225074145/http://astrosociety.org/about.html| archivedate= 25 February 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any [[hobby]], most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to [[stargazing]] and reading the latest developments in research. However, amateurs span the range from so-called &quot;armchair astronomers&quot; to the very ambitious, who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.

ASCII codes represent text in computers, [[telecommunications equipment]], and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.

The [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) prefers the name '''US-ASCII''' for this character encoding.&lt;ref name=&quot;IANA_2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|website=Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)|date=May 14, 2007|url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets|title=Character Sets|access-date=2019-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASCII is one of the [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE milestones]].

==Overview==
ASCII was developed from [[telegraph code]]. Its first commercial use was as a seven-[[bit]] [[teleprinter]] code promoted by Bell data services. Work on the ASCII standard began on October 6, 1960, with the first meeting of the [[American Standards Association]]'s (ASA) (now the [[American National Standards Institute]] or ANSI) X3.2 subcommittee.

[[File:ASCII1963-infobox-paths.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|ASCII (1963). [[Control Pictures|Control pictures]] of equivalent controls are shown where they exist, or a grey dot otherwise.]]
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the [[American Standards Association]] (ASA), called the X3 committee, by its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittee's X3.2.4 working group (now [[INCITS]]). The ASA became the [[United States of America Standards Institute]] (USASI)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|211}} and ultimately the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI).

With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963,&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCII-1963&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bukstein_1964&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Binary Computer Codes and ASCII |author-first=Ed |author-last=Bukstein |journal=[[Electronics World]] |date=July 1964 |volume=72 |number=1 |pages=28–29 |url=http://www.swtpc.com/mholley/ElectronicsWorld/Jul1964/EW_Jul1964.htm |access-date=2016-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180933/http://www.swtpc.com/mholley/ElectronicsWorld/Jul1964/EW_Jul1964.htm |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|66, 245}} There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|435}} The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to ''sticks''{{Efn|name=&quot;NB_Stick&quot;|{{anchor|Stick}}The 128 characters of the 7-bit ASCII character set are divided into eight 16-character groups called ''sticks'' 0–7, associated with the three [[most-significant bit]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bemer_1980_Inside&quot;/&gt; Depending on the horizontal or vertical representation of the character map, ''sticks'' correspond with either table rows or columns.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bemer_1980_Inside&quot;/&gt; 6 and 7,&lt;ref name=&quot;CCITT_1963&quot;&gt;Brief Report: Meeting of CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet, May 13–15, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Organization for Standardization]] TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_1963&quot;&gt;Report of ISO/TC/97/SC 2 – Meeting of October 29–31, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Report on Task Group X3.2.4, June 11, 1963, Pentagon Building, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Locating the lowercase letters in ''sticks''{{Efn|name=&quot;NB_Stick&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bemer_1980_Inside&quot;/&gt; 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified [[case-insensitive]] character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.

The X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the [[brace (punctuation)|brace]] and [[vertical bar]] characters),&lt;ref&gt;Report of Meeting No. 8, Task Group X3.2.4, December 17 and 18, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; renaming some control characters (SOM became start of header (SOH)) and moving or removing others (RU was removed).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|247–248}} ASCII was subsequently updated as USAS X3.4-1967,&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCII-1967&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter_2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=US and International standards: ASCII |url=http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/stand.html#ascii |author-first=Dik T. |author=Winter |date=2010 |orig-year=2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116001012/http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/stand.html#ascii |archive-date=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; then USAS X3.4-1968, ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCII-1986&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salste_2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=7-bit character sets: Revisions of ASCII |author-first=Tuomas |author-last=Salste |publisher=Aivosto Oy |date=January 2016 |id={{URN|nbn|fi-fe201201011004}} |url=http://www.aivosto.com/vbtips/charsets-7bit.html#body |access-date=2016-06-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613145224/http://www.aivosto.com/vbtips/charsets-7bit.html#body |archive-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They proposed a [[9-track]] standard for magnetic tape, and attempted to deal with some [[punched card]] formats.
&lt;!-- To be mentioned: [[Decimal ASCII]] --&gt;

==Design considerations==

===Bit width===
The X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems. Like other [[character encoding]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and [[character (computing)|character]] symbols (i.e. [[grapheme]]s and [[control character]]s). This allows [[Digital data|digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 [[English alphabet|alphabetic]] characters, 10 [[numerical digit]]s, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include all these, and control characters compatible with the [[CCITT|Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique]] (CCITT) [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA2) standard of 1924,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruxy_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=BruXy: Radio Teletype communication |date=2005-10-10 |access-date=2016-05-09 |url=http://bruxy.regnet.cz/web/hamradio/EN/radio-teletype-communication/ |quote=The transmitted code use International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA-2) which was introduced by CCITT in 1924. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412130035/http://bruxy.regnet.cz/web/hamradio/EN/radio-teletype-communication/ |archive-date=April 12, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bdcode&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Smith |author-first=Gil |title=Teletype Communication Codes |publisher=Baudot.net |date=2001 |url=http://www.baudot.net/docs/smith--teletype-codes.pdf |access-date=2008-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820043949/http://www.baudot.net/docs/smith--teletype-codes.pdf |archive-date=August 20, 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FIELDATA]] (1956{{citation needed|date=June 2016|reason=My sources state 1957 rather than 1956, but Wikipedia states 1956 in various places. This needs to be sorted out with better sources.}}), and early [[EBCDIC]] (1963), more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.

ITA2 were in turn based on the 5-bit telegraph code [[Émile Baudot]] invented in 1870 and patented in 1874.&lt;ref name=&quot;bdcode&quot;/&gt;

The committee debated the possibility of a [[Shift code|shift]] function (like in [[ITA2]]), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a [[six-bit character code|six-bit code]]. In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for [[data transmission]], as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|215, 236 §4}}

The committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits ([[octet (computing)|octet]]s) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [[binary-coded decimal]]. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a [[parity bit]] for [[error checking]] if desired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|217, 236 §5}} [[Eight-bit]] machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sawyer_1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author-first1=Stanley A. |author-last1=Sawyer |author-first2=Steven George |author-last2=Krantz |title=A TeX Primer for Scientists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXLDwmIJNkUC&amp;pg=PA13 |date=1995 |publisher=[[CRC Press, LLC]] |isbn=978-0-8493-7159-2 |page=13 |bibcode=1995tps..book.....S |access-date=October 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222151907/https://books.google.com/books?id=bXLDwmIJNkUC&amp;pg=PA13 |archive-date=December 22, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some printers, the high bit was used to enable [[Italics]] printing{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}.

===Internal organization===
The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. The first two so-called ''ASCII sticks''{{Efn|name=&quot;NB_Stick&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bemer_1980_Inside&quot;/&gt; (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|220, 236 8,9)}} The [[Space (punctuation)|&quot;space&quot; character]] had to come before graphics to make [[sorting algorithm|sorting]] easier, so it became position 20&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|237 §10}} for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits. The committee decided it was important to support [[upper case|uppercase]] [[sixbit code pages|64-character alphabets]], and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|228, 237 §14}} as was done in the [[DEC SIXBIT]] code (1963). [[Lower case|Lowercase]] letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase. To keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter ''A'' was placed in position 41&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|238 §18}} The digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011, but the remaining [[Nibble|4 bits]] correspond to their respective values in binary, making conversion with [[binary-coded decimal]] straightforward.

Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters; an important subtlety is that these were based on ''mechanical'' typewriters, not ''electric'' typewriters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savard&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Computer Keyboards |url=http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/kybint.htm |author-first=John J. G. |author-last=Savard |access-date=2014-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924183236/http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/kybint.htm |archive-date=September 24, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of &lt;code&gt;23456789-&lt;/code&gt; were &lt;code&gt;&quot;#$%_&amp;'()&lt;/code&gt;{{snd}} early typewriters omitted ''0'' and ''1'', using ''O'' (capital letter ''o'') and ''l'' (lowercase letter ''L'') instead, but &lt;code&gt;1!&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0)&lt;/code&gt; pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. Thus, in ASCII &lt;code&gt;!&quot;#$%&lt;/code&gt; were placed in the second stick,{{Efn|name=&quot;NB_Stick&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bemer_1980_Inside&quot;/&gt; positions 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent stick.{{Efn|name=&quot;NB_Stick&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bemer_1980_Inside&quot;/&gt; The parentheses could not correspond to ''9'' and ''0'', however, because the place corresponding to ''0'' was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; (underscore) from ''6'' and shifting the remaining characters, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with ''8'' and ''9''. This discrepancy from typewriters led to [[bit-paired keyboard]]s, notably the [[Teletype Model 33]], which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. Electric typewriters, notably the [[IBM Selectric]] (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers{{snd}} following the [[IBM PC]] (1981), especially [[Model M]] (1984){{snd}} and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The &lt;code&gt;/?&lt;/code&gt; pair also dates to the No. 2, and the &lt;code&gt;,&amp;lt; .&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; (comma) or &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). However, ASCII split the &lt;code&gt;;:&lt;/code&gt; pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly &lt;code&gt;-* =+&lt;/code&gt;) to &lt;code&gt;:* ;+ -=&lt;/code&gt;.

Some common characters were not included, notably &lt;code&gt;½¼¢&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;^`~&lt;/code&gt; were included as diacritics for international use, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for mathematical use, together with the simple line characters &lt;code&gt;\|&lt;/code&gt; (in addition to common &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;). The ''@'' symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented ''À'' in the French variation, so the ''@'' was placed in position 40&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;, right before the letter A.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|243}}

The control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), [[End of Message|end of message]] (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), &quot;who are you?&quot; (WRU), &quot;are you?&quot; (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK). These were positioned to maximize the [[Hamming distance]] between their bit patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie_1980&quot;/&gt;{{rp|243–245}}

==={{anchor|Order}}Character order===
ASCII-code order is also called ''ASCIIbetical'' order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=ASCIIbetical&amp;i=38025,00.asp |title=ASCIIbetical definition |journal=[[PC Magazine]] |access-date=2008-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309183509/http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0%2C2542%2Ct%3DASCIIbetical%26i%3D38025%2C00.asp |archive-date=March 9, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collation]] of data is sometimes done in this order rather than &quot;standard&quot; alphabetical order ([[collating sequence]]). The main deviations in ASCII order are:
* All uppercase come before lowercase letters; for example, &quot;Z&quot; precedes &quot;a&quot;
* Digits and many punctuation marks come before letters

An intermediate order converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values.

==Character groups==

==={{anchor|ASCII control characters}}Control characters===
{{Main|Control character}}

ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for [[control character]]s: codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as [[computer printer|printers]]) that make use of ASCII, or to provide [[Metadata|meta-information]] about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape.

For example, character 10 represents the &quot;line feed&quot; function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents &quot;backspace&quot;. {{IETF RFC|2822}} refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or [[Whitespace (computer science)|white space]] as non-whitespace control characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFC-2822&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=Internet Message Format |author-first=P. |author-last=Resnick |date=April 2001 |rfc=2822 |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822 |access-date=2016-06-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613203505/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822 |archive-date=2016-06-13}} (NB. NO-WS-CTL.)&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as [[markup language]]s, address page and document layout and formatting.

The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a [[data stream]], and sometimes accidental, for example with the meaning of &quot;delete&quot;.

Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 ([[Delete key|Delete]]) became de facto standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of Control-G (code 7, BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally, as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character.  Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of [[underscore]]), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as &quot;delete previous character&quot; was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.

When a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving Control-Q (XON, &quot;transmit on&quot;) caused the tape reader to resume.  This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a &quot;handshaking&quot; signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.  The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ Control-R (DC2) and Control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and &lt;s&gt;TAPE&lt;/s&gt; respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;McConnell&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding ASCII Codes |author-last1=McConnell |author-first1=Robert |author-last2=Haynes |author-first2=James |author-last3=Warren |author-first3=Richard |url=http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm |access-date=2014-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227190425/http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm |archive-date=February 27, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Delete &amp; Backspace ====

The Teletype could not move the head backwards, so it did not put a key on the keyboard to send a BS (backspace). Instead there was a key marked {{keypress|RUB OUT}} that sent code 127 (DEL). The purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a hand-typed paper tape: the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up, then type the rubout, which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html |title=Re: editor and word processor history (was: Re: RTF for emacs) |author=Barry Margolin |mailing-list=help-gnu-emacs |date=May 29, 2014 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133149/http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teletypes were commonly used for the less-expensive computers from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], so these systems had to use the available key and thus the DEL code to erase the previous character.&lt;ref name=&quot;pdp-6-monitor-manual&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/DEC-6-0-EX-SYS-UM-IP-PRE00_Multiprogramming_System_Manual_1965.pdf |title=PDP-6 Multiprogramming System Manual |page=43 |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) |date=1965 |access-date=July 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140253/http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/DEC-6-0-EX-SYS-UM-IP-PRE00_Multiprogramming_System_Manual_1965.pdf |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pdp-10-monitor-manual&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_PDP-10_Ref/1970PDP10Ref_Part3.pdf |title=PDP-10 Reference Handbook, Book 3, Communicating with the Monitor |at=p. 5-5 |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) |date=1969 |access-date=July 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115083418/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_PDP-10_Ref/1970PDP10Ref_Part3.pdf |archive-date=November 15, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, DEC video terminals (by default) sent the DEL code for the key marked &quot;Backspace&quot; while the key marked &quot;Delete&quot; sent an escape sequence, while many other terminals sent BS for the Backspace key. The Unix terminal driver could only use one code to erase the previous character, this could be set to BS ''or'' DEL, but not both, resulting in a long period of annoyance where users had to correct it depending on what terminal they were using (shells that allow line editing, such as [[KornShell|ksh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], and [[Z shell|zsh]], understand both). The assumption that no key sent a BS caused Control+H to be used for other purposes, such as the &quot;help&quot; prefix command in [[GNU Emacs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Help.html|title=Help - GNU Emacs Manual|access-date=July 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711223750/https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Help.html|archive-date=July 11, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Escape ====
Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. The &quot;escape&quot; character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of &quot;escape&quot; encountered in URL encodings, [[C (programming language)|C language]] strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so-called &quot;[[ANSI escape code]]&quot; (or, more properly, a &quot;[[Control Sequence Introducer]]&quot;) from ECMA-48 (1972) and its successors, beginning with ESC followed by a &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; (left-bracket) character. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an [[out-of-band data|out-of-band]] character used to terminate an operation, as in the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[vi]] [[text editor]]s. In [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and [[window (computing)|windowing]] systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [[exit (system call)|exit]] (terminate) altogether.

==== End of Line ====

The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring &quot;plain text&quot; files between systems. The best example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both &quot;Carriage Return&quot; (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and &quot;Line Feed&quot; (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name &quot;Carriage Return&quot; comes from the fact that on a manual [[typewriter]] the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary.  The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.

[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] operating systems ([[OS/8]], [[RT-11]], [[RSX-11]], [[RSTS/E|RSTS]], [[TOPS-10]], etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally [[Teleprinter|Teletype machines]]) would work. By the time so-called &quot;glass TTYs&quot; (later called CRTs or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. When [[Gary Kildall]] created [[CP/M]] he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s [[RT-11]]. Until the introduction of [[PC DOS]] in 1981, [[IBM]] had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless. IBM's [[PC DOS]] (also marketed as [[MS-DOS]] by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on CP/M,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dosmandrivel.blogspot.com/2007/08/is-dos-rip-off-of-cpm.html|title=Is DOS a Rip-Off of CP/M?|author=Tim Paterson|date=August 8, 2007|website=DosMan Drivel|author-link=Tim Paterson|access-date=April 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420075137/http://dosmandrivel.blogspot.com/2007/08/is-dos-rip-off-of-cpm.html|archive-date=April 20, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows]] inherited it from MS-DOS.

Unfortunately, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone. To simplify matters [[plain text]] data streams, including files, on [[Multics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.multicians.org/jhs-jfo-terminals.pdf |title=Technical and human engineering problems in connecting terminals to a time-sharing system |author-last1=Ossanna |author-first1=J.

[[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, and [[Amiga]] systems, adopted this convention from Multics. The original [[Macintosh OS]], [[Apple DOS]], and [[ProDOS]], on the other hand, used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple replaced these operating systems with the Unix-based [[macOS]] operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well. The Radio Shack [[TRS-80]] also used a lone CR to terminate lines.

Computers attached to the [[ARPANET]] included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and [[TENEX (operating system)|TENEX]] using CR-LF line endings, machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings, and machines running operating systems such as [[OS/360]] that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used [[EBCDIC]] rather than ASCII.  The [[Telnet]] protocol defined an ASCII &quot;[[Network Virtual Terminal]]&quot; (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network. Telnet used ASCII along with CR-LF line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFC-158&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=TELNET Protocol |rfc=158 |pages=4–5 |author-first=T. |author-last=O'Sullivan |date=1971-05-19 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc158 |access-date=2013-01-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613202223/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc158 |archive-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[File Transfer Protocol]] adopted the Telnet protocol, including use of the Network Virtual Terminal, for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFC-542&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=File Transfer Protocol |rfc=542 |author-first=Nancy J. |author-last=Neigus |date=1973-08-12 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc542 |access-date=2013-01-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613202314/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc542 |archive-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RFC-765&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=File Transfer Protocol |rfc=765 |author-first=Jon |author-last=Postel |author-link=Jon Postel |date=June 1980 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc765 |access-date=2013-01-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613202356/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc765 |archive-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adds complexity to implementations of those protocols, and to other network protocols, such as those used for E-mail and the World Wide Web, on systems not using the NVT's CR-LF line-ending convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/EOLTranslationPlan |title=EOL translation plan for Mercurial |publisher=Mercurial |access-date=2017-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616235536/https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/EOLTranslationPlan |archive-date=June 16, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bare LFs in SMTP |url=http://cr.yp.to/docs/smtplf.html |author-first=Daniel J. |author-last=Bernstein |author-link=Daniel J.

==== End of File/Stream ====

The PDP-6 monitor,&lt;ref name=&quot;pdp-6-monitor-manual&quot;/&gt; and its PDP-10 successor TOPS-10,&lt;ref name=&quot;pdp-10-monitor-manual&quot;/&gt; used Control-Z (SUB) as an end-of-file indication for input from a terminal.  Some operating systems such as CP/M tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used Control-Z to mark the end of the actual text in the file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/digitalResearch/cpm/1.4/CPM_1.4_Interface_Guide_1978.pdf |title=CP/M 1.4 Interface Guide |date=1978 |page=10 |publisher=[[Digital Research]] |access-date=October 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529055800/http://bitsavers.org/pdf/digitalResearch/cpm/1.4/CPM_1.4_Interface_Guide_1978.pdf |archive-date=May 29, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, EOF, or [[end-of-file]], was used colloquially and conventionally as a [[three-letter acronym]] for Control-Z instead of SUBstitute.  The end-of-text code ([[End-of-text character|ETX]]), also known as [[Control-C]], was inappropriate for a variety of reasons, while using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as a very convenient [[Mnemonic device|mnemonic aid]]. A historically common and still prevalent convention uses the ETX code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream, usually from a keyboard.

In C library and [[Unix]] conventions, the [[null character]] is used to terminate text [[string (computer science)|strings]]; such [[null-terminated string]]s can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ, where here Z stands for &quot;zero&quot;.

To delete the previous character, one had to back up the paper tape punch, which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard, then type the rubout character. They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. When systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the &quot;rubout&quot; code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo &quot;&lt;code&gt;^H&lt;/code&gt;&quot; for backspace). Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace, and systems designed for these used that character to back up. Since the delete code often produced a backspace effect, this also forced terminal manufacturers to make any {{key press|Delete}} key produce something other than the Delete character.}}

Some computer languages used characters in 1961 ASCII such as up arrow and left arrow. These characters disappeared from 1968 ASCII. We worked with Fred Mocking, who by now was in Sales at [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]], on a type cylinder that would compromise the changing characters so that the meanings of 1961 ASCII were not totally lost. The underscore character was made rather wedge-shaped so it could also serve as a left arrow.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
ASCII was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]]'s TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network. TWX originally used the earlier five-bit [[ITA2]], which was also used by the competing [[Telex]] teleprinter system. [[Robert William Bemer|Bob Bemer]] introduced features such as the [[Escape character|escape sequence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandel_1999&quot;/&gt; His British colleague [[Hugh McGregor Ross]] helped to popularize this work{{snd}} according to Bemer, &quot;so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the ''Bemer–Ross Code'' in Europe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-link=Robert William Bemer |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |url=http://www.trailing-edge.com/~bobbemer/EUROPE.HTM |title=Bemer meets Europe (Computer Standards) – Computer History Vignettes |publisher=Trailing-edge.com |access-date=2008-04-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017062722/http://www.trailing-edge.com/~bobbemer/EUROPE.HTM |archive-date=2013-10-17}} (NB. Bemer was employed at [[IBM]] at that time.)&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his extensive work on ASCII, Bemer has been called &quot;the father of ASCII&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/biographies/bemer_bob.htm |title=Robert William Bemer: Biography |date=2013-03-09 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616081929/http://www.thocp.net/biographies/bemer_bob.htm |archive-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 1968, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] mandated that all computers purchased by the [[United States Federal Government]] support ASCII, stating:&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_1968&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum Approving the Adoption by the Federal Government of a Standard Code for Information Interchange |author-last=Johnson |author-first=Lyndon Baines |author-link=Lyndon Baines Johnson |publisher=The American Presidency Project |date=1968-03-11 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=28724 |access-date=2008-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914121230/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=28724 |archive-date=September 14, 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.folklore.computers/gbg5YVFaT48/wlVFfJ2j4hYJ|title=Re: Early history of ASCII?|author=Richard S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have also approved recommendations of the [[Secretary of Commerce]] &amp;#91;[[Luther H. Hodges]]&amp;#93; regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations.
All computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July 1, 1969, must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ASCII was the most common character encoding on the [[World Wide Web]] until December 2007, when [[UTF-8]] encoding surpassed it; UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dubost_2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=UTF-8 Growth on the Web |author-last=Dubost |author-first=Karl |date=2008-05-06 |work=W3C Blog |publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] |url=http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/05/utf8-web-growth.html |access-date=2010-08-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616084132/https://www.w3.org/blog/2008/05/utf8-web-growth/ |archive-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UTF-8_2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Moving to Unicode 5.1 |author-last=Davis |author-first=Mark |author-link=Mark Davis (Unicode) |date=2008-05-05 |work=Official Google Blog |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/moving-to-unicode-51.html |access-date=2010-08-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616084637/https://googleblog.blogspot.de/2008/05/moving-to-unicode-51.html |archive-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis_2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Unicode nearing 50% of the web |author-last=Davis |author-first=Mark |author-link=Mark Davis (Unicode) |date=2010-01-28 |work=Official Google Blog |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/unicode-nearing-50-of-web.html |access-date=2010-08-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616085323/https://googleblog.blogspot.de/2010/01/unicode-nearing-50-of-web.html |archive-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Variants}}Variants and derivations==
As computer technology spread throughout the world, different [[Standardization|standards bodies]] and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as &quot;[[ASCII extension]]s&quot;, although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range. Furthermore, the ASCII extensions have also been mislabelled as ASCII.

==={{anchor|7-bit}}7-bit codes===
{{Main|ECMA-6|ISO/IEC 646|ITU T.50}}{{See also|UTF-7}}
From early in its development,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Specific Criteria&quot;, attachment to memo from R. W. Reach, &quot;X3-2 Meeting – September 14 and 15&quot;, September 18, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard.

&lt;!-- ITU-T ITU T.50
International Reference Alphabet (IRA)
International Alphabet No. 5 (IA5) --&gt;
Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as [[ISO 646]] (1967) that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English [[alphabet]] and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdom's [[pound sterling]] (£). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the US and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters.

Many other countries developed variants of ASCII to include non-English letters (e.g. [[é]], [[ñ]], [[ß]], [[Ł]]), currency symbols (e.g. [[£]], [[¥]]), etc. See also [[YUSCII]] (Yugoslavia).

It would share most characters in common, but assign other locally useful characters to several [[code point]]s reserved for &quot;national use&quot;. However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967&lt;ref name=&quot;Maréchal_1967&quot;&gt;{{citation |author-last=Maréchal |author-first=R. |title=ISO/TC 97 – Computers and Information Processing: Acceptance of Draft ISO Recommendation No. 1052 |date=1967-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.

ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, is a 7-bit character set. It does not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and, therefore, which character a code represented, and in general, text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.

Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to &quot;national use&quot; code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as

:&lt;code&gt;ä aÄiÜ = 'Ön'; ü&lt;/code&gt;

instead of

:&lt;code&gt;{ a[i] = '\n'; }&lt;/code&gt;

[[C trigraph]]s were created to solve this problem for [[ANSI C]], although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. Many programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII, so plain-text in Swedish, German etc. (for example, in e-mail or [[Usenet]]) contained &quot;{, }&quot; and similar variants in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to. For example, a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch, could get &quot;N{ jag har sm|rg}sar&quot; as the answer, which should be &quot;Nä jag har smörgåsar&quot; meaning &quot;No I've got sandwiches&quot;.

==={{anchor|8-bit}}8-bit codes===
{{Main|Extended ASCII|ISO/IEC 8859}}{{See also|UTF-8}}
&lt;!-- to be mentioned [[USASCII-8]] --&gt;
Eventually, as 8-, [[16-bit|16-]] and [[32-bit]] (and later [[64-bit]]) computers began to replace [[12-bit|12-]], [[18-bit|18-]] and [[36-bit]] computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters.

Encodings include [[ISCII]] (India), [[VISCII]] (Vietnam). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard.

Most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics. [[Kaypro]] [[CP/M]] computers used the &quot;upper&quot; 128 characters for the Greek alphabet.

The [[PETSCII]] code [[Commodore International]] used for their [[8-bit]] systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the [[ZX Spectrum character set|ZX Spectrum]] computer. [[ATASCII|Atari]] 8-bit computers and [[Galaksija (computer)#Character ROM|Galaksija]] computers also used ASCII variants.

The IBM PC defined [[code page 437]], which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as [[Emoticon|smiley faces]], and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as [[DOS]] supported these code pages, and manufacturers of [[IBM PC]]s supported them in hardware. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] developed the [[Multinational Character Set]] (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular [[VT220]] [[computer terminal|terminal]] as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. The Macintosh defined [[Mac OS Roman]] and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets.

The [[ISO/IEC 8859]] standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII, but with many substitutions). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, [[Windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as [[ISO-8859-1]]), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing.  ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until 2008 when [[UTF-8]] became more common.&lt;ref name=&quot;UTF-8_2008&quot;/&gt;

[[ISO/IEC 4873]] introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80–9F [[hexadecimal]] range, as part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unicode-5.0_2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=The Unicode Consortium |editor-first=Julie D. |editor-last=Allen |title=The Unicode standard, Version 5.0 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley Professional]] |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, US |isbn=978-0-321-48091-0 |chapter-url=http://unicode.org/book/ch13.pdf |access-date=2015-03-13 |chapter=Chapter 13: Special Areas and Format Characters |page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unicode===
{{Main|Unicode|ISO/IEC 10646}}{{See also|Basic Latin (Unicode block)}}
[[Unicode]] and the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using [[natural number]]s called ''code points'') and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]] and [[UTF-32]]).

ASCII was incorporated into the Unicode (1991) character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows [[UTF-8]] to be [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters.  Even more importantly, [[forward compatibility]] is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=utf-8(7)&amp;nbsp;– Linux manual page |publisher=Man7.org |date=2014-02-26 |url=http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/utf-8.7.html |access-date=2014-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422232059/http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/utf-8.7.html |archive-date=April 22, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animation''' is a method in which [[Image|figures]] are manipulated to appear as moving images. In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent [[cel|celluloid sheets]] to be photographed and exhibited on [[film]]. Today, most animations are made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[3D computer graphics|3D animation]], while [[2D computer graphics|2D computer animation]] can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].

Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion—as in motion pictures in general—is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact causes are still uncertain.
[[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|phénakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]] and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on the computer, techniques like [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.

Animation is more pervasive than many people realize. Apart from [[short films]], [[feature films]], television series, animated GIFs and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]], [[user interface]]s and [[visual effects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=pervasive+animation&amp;pg=PT19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Pervasive Animation|first=Suzanne|last=Buchan|date=22 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136519550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics—in for instance moving images in [[magic lantern]] shows—can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in [[automaton|automata]]. Electronic automata were popularized by [[Disney]] as [[animatronics]].

[[Animator]]s are artists who specialize in creating animation.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Etymology==
The word &quot;animation&quot; stems from the Latin &quot;animātiōn&quot;, stem of &quot;animātiō&quot;, meaning &quot;a bestowing of life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation | title=The definition of animation on dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary meaning of the English word is &quot;liveliness&quot; and has been in use much longer than the meaning of &quot;moving image medium&quot;.

==History&lt;!--'Animated cartoon' redirects here--&gt;==
{{Main|History of animation}}

===Before cinematography===
[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Nr. 10 in the reworked second series of Stampfer's stroboscopic discs published by Trentsensky &amp; Vieweg in 1833.]]
Hundreds of years before the introduction of true animation, people from all over the world enjoyed shows with moving figures that were created and manipulated manually in [[puppetry]], [[automaton|automata]], [[shadow play]] and the [[magic lantern]]. The multi-media [[phantasmagoria]] shows that were very popular in West-European theatres from the late 18th century through the first half of the 19th century, featured lifelike projections of moving ghosts and other frightful imagery in motion.

[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|A projecting [[praxinoscope]], from 1882, here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene]]
In 1833, the [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] disc (better known as the [[phenakistiscope|phénakisticope]]) introduced the principle of modern animation with sequential images that were shown one by one in quick succession to form an optical illusion of motion pictures. Series of sequential images had occasionally been made over thousands of years, but the stroboscopic disc provided the first method to represent such images in fluent motion and for the first time had artists creating series with a proper systematic breakdown of movements. The stroboscopic animation principle was also applied in the [[zoetrope]] (1866), the [[flip book]] (1868) and the [[praxinoscope]] (1877). The average 19th-century animation contained about 12 images that were displayed as a continuous loop by spinning a device manually. The flip book often contained more pictures and had a beginning and end, but its animation would not last longer than a few seconds. The first to create much longer sequences seems to have been [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]], who between 1892 and 1900 had much success with his 10- to 15-minute-long ''[[Théâtre Optique|Pantomimes Lumineuses]]''.

===Silent era===
When [[cinematography]] eventually broke through in 1895 after animated pictures had been known for decades, the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment. Animation on film was not commercialized until a few years later by manufacturers of optical toys, with [[chromolithography]] film loops (often traced from live-action footage) for adapted toy magic lanterns intended for kids to use at home. It would take some more years before animation reached movie theatres.
 
After earlier experiments by movie pioneers [[J. Stuart Blackton]], [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]], [[Segundo de Chomón]] and [[Edwin S. Porter]] (among others), Blackton's ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) was the first huge [[stop motion]] success, baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves in full photographic detail, without signs of any known stage trick.

[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) by [[Émile Cohl]]]]
[[Émile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) is the oldest known example of what became known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]]. Other great artistic and very influential short films were created by [[Ladislas Starevich]] with his puppet animations since 1910 and by [[Winsor McCay]] with detailed drawn animation in films such as ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911) and ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914).

During the 1910s, the production of animated &quot;[[cartoons]]&quot; became an industry in the US.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=28}} Successful producer [[John Randolph Bray]] and animator [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}} [[Felix the Cat]], who debuted in 1919, became the first animated superstar.

===Golden age of US animation===
In 1928, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', featuring [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Minnie Mouse]], popularized film with synchronized sound and put [[Walt Disney]]'s studio at the forefront of the animation industry. In 1932, Disney also introduced the innovation of full colour (in ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'') as part of a three-year-long exclusive deal with [[Technicolor]].

The enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the [[golden age of American animation]] that would last until the 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long-lasting careers, including [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[Goofy]] (1932) and [[Donald Duck]] (1934), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]' [[Looney Tunes]] characters like [[Daffy Duck]] (1937), [[Bugs Bunny]] (1938/1940), [[Tweety]] (1941/1942), [[Sylvester the Cat]] (1945), [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] (1949), [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Paramount Cartoon Studios]]' [[Betty Boop]] (1930), [[Popeye#Theatrical animated cartoons|Popeye]] (1933), [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]] (1941) and [[Casper the friendly ghost|Casper]] (1945), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]]'s [[Tom and Jerry]] (1940) and [[Droopy]], [[Walter Lantz Productions]]/[[Universal Studio Cartoons]]' [[Woody Woodpecker]] (1940), [[Terrytoons]]/[[20th Century Fox]]'s [[Mighty Mouse]] (1942) and [[United Artists]]' [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] (1963).

===Animated features before CGI===
[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character ''El Peludo'' (based on President [[Hipólito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyen]]) patented in 1916 for the realization of his films, including the world's first animated feature film ''[[El Apóstol]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]
In 1917, Italian-Argentine director [[Quirino Cristiani]] made the first feature-length film ''[[El Apóstol]]'' (now [[lost film|lost]]), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's ''[[Sin dejar rastros]]'' in 1918, but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government.

After working on it for three years, [[Lotte Reiniger]] released the German feature-length [[silhouette animation]] ''[[Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed]]'' in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.

In 1937, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Studios]] premiered their first animated feature, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', still one of the highest-grossing traditional animation features {{as of|lc=y| May 2020}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;snowwhite1&quot;&gt;* Total prior to 50th anniversary reissue: {{cite news |last=Culhane |first=John |title='Snow White' At 50: Undimmed Magic |date=July 12, 1987 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |quote=By now, it has grossed about $330&amp;nbsp;million worldwide - so it remains one of the most popular films ever made. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604200704/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |archive-date=June 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;snowwhite2&quot;&gt;* 1987 and 1993 grosses from North America: {{cite web |title=Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs – Releases |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&amp;id=snowwhite.htm |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |quote=1987 release – $46,594,212; 1993 release – $41,634,471 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529094807/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&amp;id=snowwhite.htm |archive-date=May 29, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940) and Fleischer Studios' second animated feature ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941/1942) failed at the box office. For decades afterwards Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until [[Ralph Bakshi]] became the first to also release more than a handful features. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1986.

Although relatively few titles became as successful as Disney's features, other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature theatrical animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including [[stop motion]] and [[cutout animation]] techniques. Russia's [[Soyuzmultfilm]] animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and reached 1,582 titles in 2018. China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France and Belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable and influential [[anime]] style of effective [[limited animation]].

===Animation on television===
Animation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most wealthy countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching [[Saturday-morning cartoon]]s. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960–1966) (the first [[prime time]] animated series), ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' (since 1969) and Belgian co-production ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (1981–1989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker [[limited animation]] methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (since 1989) as part of a &quot;renaissance&quot; of American animation.

While US animated series also spawned successes internationally, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, relatively often preferring [[stop motion]] and [[puppetry]] over cel animation. Japanese [[anime]] TV series became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, resulting in hit series such as ''[[Barbapapa]]'' (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973–1977), ''[[Vicky the Viking|Wickie und die starken Männer/小さなバイキング ビッケ (Vicky the Viking)]]'' (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974) and ''[[Once Upon a Time...|Il était une fois... (Once Upon a Time...)]]'' (France/Japan 1978).

===Switch from cel animation to computer animation===
{{main|History of computer animation}}

[[Computer animation]] was gradually developed since the 1940s. 3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s, with an early (short) appearance in the sci-fi thriller ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976).

''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera.&lt;ref name=&quot;first digital guinness&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-fully-digital-feature-film/ |title=First fully digital feature film |work=Guinness World Records |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |accessdate=2018-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced in a style that's very similar to traditional cel animation on the [[Computer Animation Production System]] (CAPS), developed by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in collaboration with [[Pixar]] in the late 1980s.

The so-called 3D style, more often associated with computer animation, has become extremely popular since Pixar's ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first computer-animated feature in this style.

Most of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance, in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/sergio-pablos-talks-about-his-stunning-hand-drawn-project-klaus-exclusive-113621.html |title=Sergio Pablos Talks About His Stunning Hand-Drawn Project 'Klaus' |last=Amidi |first=Amid |date=1 June 2015 |website=[[Cartoon Brew]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHxhr6KAaUw |title=The Origins of Klaus |date=10 October 2019 |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Abbie|title=Assignment X|url=http://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-john-kahrs-kristina-reed-on-paperman/|work=Exclusive Interview: John Kahrs &amp; Kristina Reed on PAPERMAN|publisher=Midnight Productions, Inc|accessdate=6 October 2013|date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/2/#id=I2_1340992465384&amp;parent=http%3A%2F%2Finsidemovies.ew.com&amp;rpctoken=342270562&amp;_methods=onPlusOne%2Constartinteraction%2C_ready%2C_close%2C_open%2C_resizeMe%2C_renderstart|title=FIRST LOOK: Disney's 'Paperman' fuses hand-drawn charm with digital depth|work=EW.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarto|first=Dan|title=Inside Disney's New Animated Short Paperman|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/short-films/inside-disney-s-new-animated-short-paperman|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/29/disneys-paperman-animated-short-fuses-cg-and-hand-drawn-techniques/|title=Disney's Paperman animated short fuses CG and hand-drawn techniques|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic status==
In 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.{{sfn|Board of Investments|2009}} Animated feature-length films returned the highest [[gross margin]]s (around 52%) of all [[film genre]]s between 2004 and 2013.{{sfn|McDuling|2014}} Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early 2020s.

==Education, propaganda and commercials==
The clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction, while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality. It has therefore been widely for other purposed than mere entertainment.

During World War II, animation was widely exploited for propaganda. [[World War II and American animation|Many American studios]], including Warner Bros. and Disney, lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey the public of certain war values. Some countries, including China, Japan and the United Kingdom, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts.

Animation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Snap, Crackle, Pop® {{!}} Rice Krispies®|url=https://www.ricekrispies.com/en_US/our-story.html|access-date=2020-06-16|website=www.ricekrispies.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] &quot;[[Kills Bugs Dead]]&quot; commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Taylor|first=Heather|date=2019-06-10|title=The Raid Bugs: Characters We Love To Hate|url=https://popicon.life/the-raid-bugs-characters-we-love-to-hate/|access-date=2020-06-16|website=PopIcon.life|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-off enterprises: other media, merchandise and theme parks==
Apart from their success in movie theaters and television series, many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media.

Animation has traditionally been very closely related to [[comic book]]s. While many comic book characters found their way to the screen (which is often the case in Japan, where many [[manga]] are adapted into [[anime]]), original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines. Somewhat similarly, characters and plots for [[video game]]s (an interactive animation medium) have been derived from films and vice versa.

Some of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media. Stories and images can easily be adapted into children's books and other printed media. Songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media.

While very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, [[The Walt Disney Company]] is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children's writing tablet in 1929, their [[Mickey Mouse]] mascot has been [[Mickey Mouse#Merchandising|depicted on an enormous amount of products]], as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some [[Mickey Mouse#pejorative use of Mickey's name|pejorative use of Mickey's name]], but [[Disney Consumer Products|licensed Disney products]] sell well, and the so-called [[Disneyana]] has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub (since 1984).

[[Disneyland]] opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney's cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products#Disney resorts|Disney theme parks and resorts]]. [[The Walt Disney Company#Financial data|Disney's earnings]] from the theme parks has relatively often been higher than those from their movies.

==Criticism==
Criticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films.{{sfn|Amidi|2011}} Many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.{{sfn|Nagel|2008}}

==Awards==
{{Main|Animation studio#American studios}}
As with any other form of media, animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field. The original awards for animation were presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th [[Academy Awards]] function. The first winner of the [[5th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] was the short ''Flowers and Trees'',{{sfn|Walt Disney Family Museum|2013}} a production by [[Walt Disney Productions]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=37}}{{sfn|Shaffer|2010|page=211}} The Academy Award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. It was won by the film ''[[Shrek]]'', produced by [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] and [[Pacific Data Images]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=84–85}} [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Animation]] and [[Pixar]] has produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award. ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture. ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' also received Best Picture nominations after the Academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.
* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]
* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]

Several other countries have instituted an award for the best-animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation]] (since 2008), [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006), [[César Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2011), [[Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation]] (since 1981), [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 1989), [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (since 2007), [[National Film Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006). Also since 2007, the [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] has been awarded at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. Since 2009, the [[European Film Awards]] have awarded the [[European Film Award for Best Animated Film]].

The [[Annie Award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavour. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated Feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney; however, newer studios, led by Pixar &amp; DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. The list of awardees is as follows:
* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]
* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject]]
* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production]]

==Production==
[[File:Joy &amp;amp; Heron - Animated CGI Spot by Passion Pictures.webm|thumb|''Joy &amp; Heron'' – A featured video]]
The creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of [[filmmaking]], with certain unique aspects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=117}} Traits common to both live-action and animated [[Feature film|feature-length films]] are labor intensity and high production costs.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=274}}


The most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the [[marginal cost]] of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.{{sfn|White|2006|p=151}} It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more [[take]] during [[principal photography]] of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=339}} It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=55}} Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where [[storyboard artist]]s develop every single scene through [[storyboard]]s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=120}} While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=100–01}}

Another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=94}} Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=37}}

This problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw [[model sheet]]s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=146}} On traditionally animated projects, [[maquette]]s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52–57}}{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}

Unlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=99–100}} In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.

== Techniques ==

=== Traditional animation ===
{{Main|Traditional animation}}

[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos]]

'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2006|p=31}} The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=153}} To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277–79}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195–201}}

The traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35 mm movie film|35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35–36, 52–53}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The &quot;look&quot; of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52–57}} Some animation producers have used the term &quot;[[tradigital art|tradigital]]&quot; (a play on the words &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;digital&quot;) to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.

Examples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63–65}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (US, 1998), ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988),{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=80}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).

==== Full animation ====
'''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement,{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=71}} having a smooth animation.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=194–95}} Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''The Lion King'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25–26}}

==== Limited animation ====

{{Main|Limited animation}}

'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or &quot;skippy&quot; movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54–55}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later the [[Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).

==== Rotoscoping ====

{{Main|Rotoscoping}}

'''Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163–64}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (2013).

==== Live-action/animation ====

{{Main|Films with live action and animation}}

'''[[List of films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live-action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162–63}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live-action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18–19}} Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of ''[[Alice Comedies]]'' (1923–1927), in which a live-action girl enters an animated world. Other examples include ''[[Allegro Non Troppo]]'' (Italy, 1976), ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (US, 1988), ''[[Volere volare]]'' (Italy 1991), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (US, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (US, 2001).

=== Stop motion animation ===
{{Main|Stop motion}}

'''Stop-motion animation''' is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}} There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}} Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop-motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}}
* '''[[Puppet animation]]''' typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=171}} The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=155–56}} Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Jiří Trnka]] and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005–present).
** '''[[Puppetoon]]''', created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]],{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=70}} are puppet-animated films that typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=92–93}}
[[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]
* '''[[Clay animation]]''', or [[Plasticine]] animation (often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademarked]] name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}}{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=150–151}} The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=151–54}} Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include ''The [[Gumby]] Show'' (US, 1957–1967), ''[[Mio Mao]]'' (Italy, 1974–2005), ''[[Morph (animation)|Morph]]'' shorts (UK, 1977–2000), ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' shorts (UK, as of 1989), [[Jan Švankmajer]]'s ''[[Dimensions of Dialogue]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1982), ''[[The Trap Door]]'' (UK, 1984). Films include ''[[Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', ''[[Chicken Run]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985 film)|The Adventures of Mark Twain]]''.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=250}}
** '''[[Strata-cut animation]]''', Strata-cut animation is most commonly a form of clay animation in which a long bread-like &quot;loaf&quot; of clay, internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery, is sliced into thin sheets, with the animation camera taking a frame of the end of the loaf for each cut, eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within.{{sfn|Furniss|1998|pp=52–54}}
* '''[[Cutout animation]]''' is a type of stop-motion animation produced by moving two-dimensional pieces of material paper or cloth.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=59–60}} Examples include [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animated sequences from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (UK, 1969–1974); ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'' (France/Czechoslovakia, 1973); ''[[Tale of Tales (1979 film)|Tale of Tales]]'' (Russia, 1979), The pilot episode of the adult television sitcom series (and sometimes in episodes) of ''[[South Park]]'' (US, 1997) and the music video Live for the moment, from Verona Riots band (produced by Alberto Serrano and Nívola Uyá, Spain 2014).
**'''[[Silhouette animation]]''' is a variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=170–171}} Examples include ''[[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]]'' ([[Weimar Republic]], 1926) and ''[[Princes et Princesses]]'' (France, 2000).
* '''[[Model animation]]''' refers to stop-motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live-action world.{{sfn|Harryhausen|Dalton|2008|pages=9–11}} Intercutting, [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]] effects and split screens are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harryhausen_Dalton222–226&quot;/&gt; Examples include the work of [[Ray Harryhausen]], as seen in films, ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963),&lt;ref name=&quot;Harryhausen_Dalton18&quot;/&gt; and the work of [[Willis H. O'Brien]] on films, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933).
**'''[[Go motion]]''' is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create [[motion blur]] between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop motion.{{sfn|Smith|1986|p=90}} The technique was invented by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] and [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[special effect]] scenes for the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).{{sfn|Watercutter|2012}} Another example is the dragon named &quot;Vermithrax&quot; from 1981 film ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]''.{{sfn|Smith|1986|pages=91–95}}
* '''[[Object animation]]''' refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=51–57}}
** '''[[Graphic animation]]''' uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), which are sometimes manipulated frame by frame to create movement.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=128}} At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.
** '''[[Brickfilm]]''' are a subgenre of object animation involving using [[Lego]] or other similar brick toys to make an animation.{{sfn|Paul|2005|pages=357–63}}{{sfn|Herman|2014}} These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites, [[YouTube]] and the availability of cheap cameras and [[animation software]].{{sfn|Haglund|2014}}
* '''[[Pixilation]]''' involves the use of live humans as stop-motion characters.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75–79}} This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other effects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75–79}} Examples of pixilation include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' and ''[[Angry Kid]]'' shorts, and the [[Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]'' by [[Norman McLaren]].

=== Computer animation ===
{{Main|Computer animation}}
'''Computer animation''' encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}}{{sfn|Serenko|2007}} 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=405}} 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.{{sfn|Serenko|2007|p=482}}

==== 2D animation ====
{{main|2D computer graphics}}
[[File:Catenary animation.gif|thumb|A 2D animation of two circles joined by a chain]]

[[2D computer graphics|2D animation]] figures are created or edited on the computer using 2D [[Raster graphics|bitmap graphics]] and 2D [[vector graphics]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=165}} This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques, [[Interpolation|interpolated]] [[morphing]],{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=32, 70, 132}} [[onion skinning]]{{sfn|Priebe|2006|pp=71–72}} and interpolated rotoscoping.

2D animation has many applications, including [[Scanimate|analog computer animation]], [[Flash animation]], and [[PowerPoint animation]]. [[Cinemagraph]]s are [[Still life photography|still photographs]] in the form of an [[animated GIF]] file of which part is animated.{{sfn|White|2006|p=392}}

Final line [[advection]] animation is a technique used in 2D animation,{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|pp=246–47}} to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department.{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=127–28}} Speaking about using this approach in ''[[Paperman]]'', John Kahrs said that &quot;Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm.&quot;{{sfn|Beck|2012}}

==== 3D animation ====
{{Main|Computer animation|3D computer graphics}}
3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. The animator usually starts by creating a 3D [[polygon mesh]] to manipulate.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} A mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces, which give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=88}} Sometimes, the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an [[Armature (computer animation)|armature]] that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=208}}{{sfn|Masson|2007|pp=78–80}} This process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with [[key frame]]s to create movement.{{sfn|Sito|2013|p=285}}

Other techniques can be applied, mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects, fire and [[fluid animation|water simulations]].{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=96}} These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.{{sfn|Lowe|Schnotz|2008|p=92}}

===== 3D terms =====
* '''[[Cel-shaded animation]]''' is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cel Shading: the Unsung Hero of Animation?|url=http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|publisher=Animator Mag|accessdate=20 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305090445/http://www.animatormag.com/computer/cel-shading-hero-animation/|archivedate=5 March 2016|date=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shading looks stark, with less blending of colors. Examples include ''[[Skyland]]'' (2007, France), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (1999, United States), ''[[Futurama]]'' (Fox, 1999) ''[[Appleseed Ex Machina]]'' (2007, Japan), ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'' (2002, Japan), ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'' (2017, Japan)
* '''[[Machinima]]''' – Films created by screen capturing in video games and virtual worlds. The term originated from the software introduction in the 1980s [[demoscene]], as well as the 1990s recordings of the [[first-person shooter]] video game ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''.
* '''[[Motion capture]]''' is used when live-action actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into CG characters.{{sfn|Sito|2013|pp=207–08}}{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=204}} Examples include ''[[The Polar Express (film)|Polar Express]]'' (2004, US), ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'' (2007, US), ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' (2009, US), ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (2011, US) ''[[Kochadaiiyaan|kochadiiyan]]'' (2014, India)
* '''[[Computer animation]]''' is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life, using advanced rendering that mimics in detail skin, plants, water, fire, clouds, etc.{{sfn|Parent|2007|p=19}} Examples include ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' (2009, US), ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010, US)
* '''[[Physically based animation]]''' is animation using [[computer simulation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald H. House|author2=John C. Keyser|title=Foundations of Physically Based Modeling and Animation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELXZDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=animation&amp;f=false|date=30 November 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-315-35581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanical animation ===
* '''[[Animatronics]]''' is the use of [[mechatronics]] to create machines that seem animate rather than robotic.
** '''[[Audio-Animatronics]] and Autonomatronics''' is a form of [[robotics]] animation, combined with 3-D animation, created by [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] for shows and attractions at Disney theme parks move and make noise (generally a recorded speech or song).{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=249}} They are fixed to whatever supports them. They can sit and stand, and they cannot walk. An Audio-Animatron is different from an [[android (robot)|android]]-type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds, rather than responding to external stimuli. In 2009, Disney created an interactive version of the technology called Autonomatronics.{{sfn|O'Keefe|2014}}
** '''Linear Animation Generator''' is a form of animation by using static picture frames installed in a tunnel or a shaft. The animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion, parallel to the installed picture frames.{{sfn|Parent|2007|pages=22–23}} The concept and the technical solution were invented in 2007 by Mihai Girlovan in Romania.
* '''[[Chuckimation]]''' is a type of animation created by the makers of the television series ''[[Action League Now!]]'' in which characters/props are thrown, or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands.{{sfn|Kenyon|1998}}
* The '''[[Magic lantern#Moving images|magic lantern]]''' used mechanical slides to project moving images, probably since [[Christiaan Huygens]] invented this early image projector in 1659.

=== Other animation styles, techniques, and approaches ===
[[File:World of Color overview.jpg|thumb|''[[World of Color]]'' hydrotechnics at [[Disney California Adventure]] creates illusion of motion using 1,200 fountains with high-definition projections on mist screens.]]
* '''Hydrotechnics''': a technique that includes lights, water, fire, fog, and lasers, with high-definition projections on mist screens.
* '''[[Drawn on film animation]]''': a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on [[film stock]]; for example, by [[Norman McLaren]],{{sfn|Faber|Walters|2004|p=1979}} [[Len Lye]] and [[Stan Brakhage]].
* '''[[Paint-on-glass animation]]''': a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying [[oil paint]]s on sheets of glass,{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=222}} for example by [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]].
* '''Erasure animation''': a technique using traditional 2D media, photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image. For example, [[William Kentridge]] is famous for his [[charcoal]] erasure films,{{sfn|Carbone|2010}} and [[Piotr Dumała]] for his auteur technique of animating scratches on plaster.
* '''[[Pinscreen animation]]''': makes use of a screen filled with movable pins that can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen.{{sfn|Neupert|2011}} The screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows. The technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation.{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=204}}
* '''[[Sand animation]]''': sand is moved around on a back- or front-[[light]]ed piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film.{{sfn|Brown|2003|p=7}} This creates an interesting effect when animated because of the light [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]].{{sfn|Furniss|1998|pp=30–33}}
* '''[[Flip book]]''': a flip book (sometimes, especially in British English, called a flick book) is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=22–24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=8–10}} Flip books are often illustrated books for children,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=xiv}} they also be geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings. Flip books are not always separate books, they appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, often in the page corners.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=22–24}} Software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.{{sfn|White|2006|p=203}}
* '''[[Character animation]]'''
* '''[[Multi-sketch]]ing'''
* '''[[Special effect]]s animation'''

'''Apollo'''{{efn|[[Attic Greek|Attic]], [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], [[Homeric Greek|Homeric]] and {{lang-grc-koi|Ἀπόλλων|''Apóllōn''}}, {{lang-grc|Ἀπόλλωνος|''Apóllōnos''|label=genitive}} {{IPA-grc|a.pól.lɔːn|att-ion-pron}}, {{IPA-grc|a.pól.lɔː.nos|}}; {{IPA-grc|aˈpol.lon|koine}}, {{IPA-la|aˈpol.lo.nos|}}&lt;br/&gt; {{lang-grc-dor|Ἀπέλλων|''Apéllōn''}}, {{IPA-grc|a.pel.lɔ̂ːn|dor-pron}}; {{lang-grc|Ἀπείλων|''Apeílōn''|label=[[Arcadocypriot Greek]]}}, {{IPA-grc|a.pěː.lɔːn|ark}}; {{lang-grc-aeo|Ἄπλουν|''Áploun''}}, {{IPA-grc|á.ploːn|aeo}}&lt;br/&gt; {{lang-la|Apollō}}, {{lang-la|Apollinis|label=genitive}} {{IPA-la|aˈpɔl.lʲoː|classical}}, {{IPA-la|aˈpɔl.lʲɪ.n̪ɪs|}};  {{IPA-la|aˈpɔl.lɔ|late}}, {{IPA-la|aˈpɔl.li.n̪is|}}}} is one of the  [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian deities]] in [[Ancient Greek religion|classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman religion|Roman religion]] and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. The national divinity of the Greeks, Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the [[Sun]] and light, poetry, and more. One of the most important and complex of the Greek gods, he is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin brother of [[Artemis]], goddess of the hunt. Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the ''[[kouros]]'' (ephebe, or a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced [[Etruscan mythology]] as ''Apulu''.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, I. 2006. &quot;The Grave and Beyond.&quot; ''The Religion of the Etruscans.'' edited by N. de Grummond and E. Simon. Austin: University of Texas Press. p. vii, p. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the patron deity of [[Delphi]] (''Apollo Pythios''), Apollo is an [[oracular]] god—the prophetic [[deity]] of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]]. Apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil; various epithets call him the &quot;averter of evil&quot;. Delphic Apollo is the patron of seafarers, foreigners and the protector of fugitives and refugees.

Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son [[Asclepius]]. Apollo delivered people from epidemics, yet he is also a god who could bring ill-health and deadly [[Plague (disease)|plague]] with his arrows. The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis. Apollo is usually described as carrying a golden bow and a quiver of silver arrows. Apollo's capacity to make youths grow is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona. As the protector of young (''kourotrophos''), Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children. He presided over their passage into adulthood. Long hair, which was the prerogative of boys, was cut at the coming of age (ephebeia) and dedicated to Apollo.

Apollo is an important pastoral deity, and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds. Protection of herds, flocks and crops from diseases, pests and predators were his primary duties. On the other hand, Apollo also encouraged founding new towns and establishment of civil constitution. He is associated with dominion over [[Colonies in antiquity|colonists]]. He was the giver of laws, and his oracles were consulted before setting laws in a city.

As the god of ''Mousike'' (art of Muses), Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music, and the frequent companion of the Muses, functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations. The lyre is a common [[Apollo#Attributes and symbols|attribute of Apollo]]. In Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as ''Apollo Helios'' he became identified among Greeks with [[Helios]], [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[solar deity|god of the sun]].&lt;ref&gt;For the iconography of the Alexander–Helios type, see H. Hoffmann, 1963. &quot;Helios&quot;, in ''Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt'' '''2''', pp. 117–23; cf. Yalouris 1980, no. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin texts, however, there was no [[conflation]] of Apollo with [[Sol (Roman mythology)|Sol]] among the classical Latin poets until 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fontenrose, &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Latin poets of the first century BC&quot;, ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''30''' (1939), pp 439–55; &quot;Apollo and the Sun-God in Ovid&quot;, ''American Journal of Philology'' '''61''' (1940) pp 429–44; and &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Oaths of Aeneas and Latinus&quot; ''Classical Philology'' '''38'''.2 (April 1943), pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century CE.

==Etymology==

[[File:MANNapoli 6281 Sitting Apollo Farnese.jpg|thumb|Apollo seated with [[lyre]]. [[Porphyry (geology)|Porphyry]] and marble, 2nd century AD. [[Farnese collection]], Naples, Italy.|alt=|373x373px]]
Apollo ([[Attic Greek|Attic]], [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], and [[Homeric Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων}}, ''Apollōn'' ({{small|[[Genitive|GEN]]}} {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλωνος}}); [[Doric Greek|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}, ''Apellōn''; [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπείλων}}, ''Apeilōn''; [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]]: {{lang|grc|Ἄπλουν}}, ''Aploun''; {{lang-la|Apollō}})

The name ''Apollo''—unlike the related [[List of Mycenaean deities|older name]] ''Paean''—is generally not found in the [[Linear B]] ([[Mycenean Greek]]) texts, although there is a possible attestation in the [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunose]] form '']pe-rjo-['' (Linear B: ]{{lang|gmy|𐀟𐁊}}-[) on the [[Knossos|KN]] E 842 tablet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S.

The [[etymology]] of the name is uncertain. The spelling {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων}} ({{IPA-el|a.pól.lɔːn|pron}} in [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic]]) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the [[common era]], but the [[Dorians|Doric]] form, ''Apellon'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}), is more archaic, as it is derived from an earlier {{lang|grc|*Ἀπέλjων}}. It probably is a cognate to the Doric month ''Apellaios'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπελλαῖος}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=van der Toorn |first1=Karel |last2=Becking |first2=Bob |last3=van der Horst |first3=Pieter Willem |title=Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PHgUAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA73 |year=1999 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-11119-6 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the offerings [[apellaia]] ({{lang|grc|ἀπελλαῖα}}) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival [[apellai]] ({{lang|grc|ἀπέλλαι}}).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The young men became grown-up [[kouros|kouroi]], and Apollon was the &quot;megistos kouros&quot; (The Great Kouros) : Jane Ellen Harrison (2010): ''Themis: A study to the Social origins of Greek Religion'' Cambridge University Press. pp. 439–441, {{ISBN|1108009492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Visible Religion. Volume IV–V. Approaches to Iconology.'' Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1985 p. 143 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UesUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=apellaia#v=onepage&amp;q=apellaia]&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to some scholars, the words are derived from the Doric word ''apella'' ({{lang|grc|ἀπέλλα}}), which originally meant &quot;wall,&quot; &quot;fence for animals&quot; and later &quot;assembly within the limits of the square.&quot;&lt;ref name=Nilsson556&gt;The word usually appears in plural: [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]: {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλαι}} (''apellai''), {{lang|grc|σηκοί}} (&quot;folds&quot;), {{lang|grc|ἐκκλησίαι}} (&quot;assemblies&quot;), {{lang|grc|ἀρχαιρεσίαι}} (&quot;elections&quot;): Nilsson, Vol. I, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doric Greek verb: {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλάζειν}} (&quot;to assemble&quot;), and the festival {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλαι}} (''apellai''), which surely belonged to Apollo. Nilsson, Vol I, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apella]] ({{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλα}}) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta,&lt;ref name=Nilsson556/&gt; corresponding to the ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἐκκλησία}}). [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun ''apellai'' and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] proto-form *''Apal&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;un''.&lt;ref&gt;Beekes, 2009, pp. 115 and 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several instances of [[popular etymology]] are attested from ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb {{lang|grc|ἀπόλλυμι}} (''apollymi''), &quot;to destroy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Campbell |url=http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=apollo |title=Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Apollo |publisher=Behind the Name |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus]]'' connects the name with {{lang|grc|ἀπόλυσις}} (''apolysis''), &quot;redemption&quot;, with {{lang|grc|ἀπόλουσις}} (''apolousis''), &quot;purification&quot;, and with {{lang|grc|ἁπλοῦν}} (''[h]aploun''), &quot;simple&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;The {{lang|grc|ἁπλοῦν}} suggestion is repeated by [[Plutarch]] in ''[[Moralia]]'' in the sense of &quot;[[1 (number)|unity]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, {{lang|grc|Ἄπλουν}}, and finally with {{lang|grc|Ἀειβάλλων}} (''aeiballon''), &quot;ever-shooting&quot;. [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] connects the name Apollo with the Doric {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλα}} (''apella''), which means &quot;assembly&quot;, so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation {{lang|grc|σηκός}} (''sekos''), &quot;fold&quot;, in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=184}} In the [[ancient Macedonian language]] {{lang|grc|πέλλα}} (''pella'') means &quot;stone,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1168.&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[toponyms]] may be derived from this word: {{lang|grc|Πέλλα}} ([[Pella]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pe/lla|πέλλα|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the capital of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Macedonia]]) and {{lang|grc|Πελλήνη}} (''Pellēnē''/''[[Pallini|Pallene]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson Vol I, p.558&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of non-Greek etymologies have been suggested for the name,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'', vol. I (C. H. Beck), 1955:555–564.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] form ''[[Apaliunas]]'' (''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;''{{lang|hit-Latn|x-ap-pa-li-u-na-aš}}) is attested in the [[Manapa-Tarhunta letter]],&lt;ref&gt;The reading of ''Apaliunas'' and the possible identification with Apollo is due to [[Emil Forrer]] (1931). It was doubted by [[Paul Kretschmer|Kretschmer]], ''Glotta'' XXIV, p. 250. Martin Nilsson (1967), Vol I, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps related to [[Hurrian]] (and certainly the [[List of Etruscan mythological figures|Etruscan]]) ''[[Aplu (deity)|Aplu]]'', a god of plague, in turn likely from [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''Aplu Enlil'' meaning simply &quot;the son of [[Enlil]]&quot;, a title that was given to the god [[Nergal]], who was linked to [[Shamash]], Babylonian god of the sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grummond&quot;&gt;de Grummond, Nancy Thomson (2006) ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend''. (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology); Mackenzie, Donald A. (2005) ''Myths of Babylonia and Assyria'' (Gutenberg)&lt;/ref&gt;
The role of Apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of [[Apollo Smintheus]] (&quot;mouse Apollo&quot;) by Chryses, the Trojan priest of Apollo, with the purpose of sending a plague against the Greeks (the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is [[apotropaic]], meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague).

The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] testimony reflects an early form ''{{lang|grc-Latn|*Apeljōn}}'', which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot {{lang|grc|Ἀπείλων}} with Doric {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Angel |first1=John L. |last2=Mellink |first2=Machteld Johanna | title = Troy and the Trojan War: A Symposium Held at Bryn Mawr College, October 1984| year = 1986| publisher = Bryn Mawr Commentaries| isbn = 978-0-929524-59-7| page = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the Lydian god ''Qλdãns'' /kʷʎðãns/ may reflect an earlier /kʷalyán-/ before palatalization, syncope, and the pre-Lydian sound change *y ''&gt;'' d.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgQowuFZeLUC&amp;pg=PA338|title=Anatolian Historical Phonology|last=Melchert|first=Harold Craig|date=1994|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-9051836974|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note the labiovelar in place of the labial /p/ found in pre-Doric ''Ἀπέλjων'' and Hittite ''Apaliunas''.

A [[Luwian language|Luwian]] etymology suggested for ''Apaliunas'' makes Apollo &quot;The One of Entrapment&quot;, perhaps in the sense of &quot;Hunter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Immerwahr |first1=Sara Anderson |last2=Chapin |first2=Anne Proctor | title = Charis: Essays in Honor of Sara A.

===Greco-Roman epithets===
Apollo's chief [[epithet]] was '''Phoebus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|b|ə|s}} {{respell|FEE|bəs}}; {{lang|grc|Φοῖβος}}, ''Phoibos'' {{IPA-el|pʰó͜i.bos}}), literally &quot;bright&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1582.&lt;/ref&gt; It was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans for Apollo's role as the god of light. Like other Greek deities, he had a number of others applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god. However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in [[Latin literature]].

The meaning of the epithet &quot;Lyceus&quot; later became associated with Apollo's mother [[Leto]], who was the patron goddess of [[Lycia]] ({{lang|grc|Λυκία}}) and who was identified with the wolf ({{lang|grc|λύκος}}).&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''On the Nature of Animals'' 4. 4 (A.F.

====Origin and birth====
Apollo's birthplace was [[Cynthus|Mount Cynthus]] on the island of [[Delos]].

*'''Cynthius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|θ|i|ə|s}} {{respell|SIN|thee|əs}}; {{lang|grc|Κύνθιος}}, ''Kunthios''), literally &quot;Cynthian&quot;

===Celtic epithets and cult titles===

==Origins==
[[File:Omphalos museum.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Omphalos]] in the Museum of [[Delphi]]]]
The cult centers of Apollo in Greece, [[Delphi]] and [[Delos]], date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to [[Artemis]], Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of [[Pytho]]. For the Greeks, Apollo was all the gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods. In [[archaic period in Greece|archaic Greece]] he was the [[prophet]], the oracular god who in older times was connected with &quot;healing&quot;. In [[classical period in Greece|classical Greece]] he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967)&quot;.Die Geschicte der Giechischen Religion.Vol I&quot;.C.F.Beck Verlag.Munchen. p 529&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Burkert]]&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, Walter. ''Greek Religion'', 1985:144.&lt;/ref&gt; discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed &quot;a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component.&quot;

From his eastern origin Apollo brought the art of inspection of &quot;symbols and [[omen|omina]]&quot; (σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα : ''sēmeia kai terata''), and of the observation of the [[omen]]s of the days. The inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from [[Anatolia]]. The [[ritual]]ism belonged to Apollo from the beginning. The Greeks created the [[Legalism (Western philosophy)|legalism]], the supervision of the orders of the gods, and the demand for moderation and harmony. Apollo became the god of shining youth, ideal beauty, fine arts, philosophy, moderation, spiritual-life, the protector of music, divine law and perceptible order. The improvement of the old [[Anatolia]]n god, and his elevation to an intellectual sphere, may be considered an achievement of the [[Greek people]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nilsson563&quot;&gt;[[Martin P. Nilsson|Martin Nilsson]]. ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion Vol I'', pp. 563–564&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healer and god-protector from evil===
The function of Apollo as a &quot;healer&quot; is connected with [[Paean (god)|Paean]] ({{lang|grc|Παιών-Παιήων}}), the physician of the gods in the ''[[Iliad]]'', who seems to come from a more primitive religion.&lt;ref&gt;Paieon ({{lang|grc|Παιήων}}) puts pain-relieving medicines on the wounds of Pluton and Ares ( [[Iliad|Ilias]] E401). This art is related with Egypt: ([[Odyssey]] D232): M. Nilsson Vol I, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt; Paeοn is probably connected with the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] ''pa-ja-wo-ne'' (Linear B: {{lang|gmy|𐀞𐀊𐀺𐀚}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mycenaeans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXwzT1048Z4C&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage|page=160|first=Louise|last=Schofield|year=2007|publisher=The British Museum Press|isbn=978-0-89236-867-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/linear-b-transliterations/knossos/kn-v/kn-v/#toc-kn-v-52|title=KN V 52+|website=Deaditerranean: Minoan Linear A &amp; Mycenaean Linear B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chawick&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=John|author-link=John Chadwick|title=The Mycenaean World|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1976|isbn=978-0-521-29037-1|url=https://archive.org/details/mycenaeanworld00chad|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/mycenaeanworld00chad/page/89 89]}} At Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not certain. He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease. Later the Greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song &quot;paean&quot; ({{lang|grc|παιάν}}). The magicians were also called &quot;seer-doctors&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἰατρομάντεις}}), and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god Apollo at the oracles.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|Ἐπὶ καταπαύσει λοιμῶν καὶ νόσων ᾄδόμενος}}. ''Which is sung to stop the plagues and the diseases''. Proklos: Chrestom from Photios Bibl. code. 239, p. 321: Martin Nilsson. Die Geschicthe der Griechischen religion. Vol I, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Iliad'', Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the [[Vedic]] god of disease [[Rudra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 541&quot;&gt;&quot;The conception that the diseases come from invisible shots sent by magicians or supernatural beings is common in primitive people and also in European folklore. In North-Europe they speak of the &quot;[[Elf-shot]]s&quot;. In Sweden where the Lapps were called magicians, they speak of the &quot;Lappen-shots&quot;. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt; He sends a plague ({{lang|grc|λοιμός}}) to the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]]. The god who sends a disease can also prevent it; therefore, when it stops, they make a purifying ceremony and offer him a [[hecatomb]] to ward off evil. When the oath of his priest appeases, they pray and with a song they call their own god, the ''Paean''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad|Ilias]] A 314. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common epithets of Apollo as a healer are &quot;paion&quot; ({{lang|grc|παιών}} literally &quot;healer&quot; or &quot;helper&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0062:entry=paean-harpers]: Harper's Dictionary of classical antiquity&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;epikourios&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἐπικούριος}}, &quot;succouring&quot;), &quot;oulios&quot; ({{lang|grc|οὔλιος}}, &quot;healer, baleful&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ou)/lios|οὔλιος|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;loimios&quot; ({{lang|grc|λοίμιος}}, &quot;of the plague&quot;). In classical times, his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and was therefore called &quot;apotropaios&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἀποτρόπαιος}}, &quot;averting evil&quot;) and &quot;alexikakos&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἀλεξίκακος}} &quot;keeping off ill&quot;; from [[verb|v.]] {{lang|grc|ἀλέξω}} + [[noun|n.]] {{lang|grc|κακόν}}).&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias VIII 41, 8-IV 34, 7-Sittig. Nom P. 48. f-Aristoph. Vesp. V. 61-Paus. I 3, 4. Martin Nilsson (1967) Vol I, p. 540, 544&lt;/ref&gt; In later writers, the word, usually spelled &quot;Paean&quot;, becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of [[healing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Graf| first = Fritz| title = Apollo| url = https://books.google.com/?id=it9n9_I-UOkC&amp;pg=PA66| year = 2008| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| isbn = 978-0-203-58171-1| page = 66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homer illustrated Paeon the god and the song both of [[apotropaic]] thanksgiving or triumph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2199?msg=welcome_stranger|title=The Iliad|last=Homer|first=750? BCE-650? BCE|date=2000-06-01|language=English|translator-last=Butler|translator-first=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo and afterwards to other gods: to [[Dionysus]], to Apollo [[Helios]], to Apollo's son [[Asclepius]] the healer. About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognized as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the [[Python (mythology)|Python]] led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.

===Dorian origin===
[[File:Apollo-WaltersArt.jpg|left|thumb|''Apollo Victorious over the Python'' by the Florentine [[Pietro Francavilla]] (dated 1591) depicting Apollo's first triumph, when he slew with his bow and arrows the serpent Python, which lies dead at his feet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[The Walters Art Museum]]

The connection with the Dorians and their initiation festival ''[[apellai]]'' is reinforced by the month ''Apellaios'' in northwest Greek calendars.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, ''Apollo'', pp. 104–113; Burkert also notes in this context [[Archilochus]] ''Fr''. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The family-festival was dedicated to Apollo ([[Dorians|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert (1985) ''Greek Religion''. Harvard University Press. p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apellaios'' is the month of these rites, and Apellon is the &quot;megistos kouros&quot; (the great Kouros).&lt;ref&gt;Jane Ellen Harrison (2010): ''Themis: A study to the Social origins of Greek Religion''. Cambridge University Press. p. 441. {{ISBN|1108009492}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it can explain only the Doric type of the name, which is connected with the [[Ancient Macedonian language|Ancient Macedonian]] word &quot;pella&quot; ([[Pella]]), ''stone''. Stones played an important part in the cult of the god, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi ([[Omphalos]]).&lt;ref&gt;Compare: [[Baetylus]]. In Semitic: sacred stone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I. p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;[[Homeric hymn]]&quot; represents Apollo as a Northern intruder. His arrival must have occurred during the &quot;[[Greek Dark Ages|Dark Ages]]&quot; that followed the destruction of the [[Mycenaean civilization]] and his conflict with [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Mother Earth) was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent [[Python (mythology)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Park (1956). ''The delphic oracle''. Vol.I, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth deity had power over the ghostly world and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Farnel(1909)''The cult of the city states. Clarendon Press. VIII. pp. 8–10''&lt;/ref&gt; The older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated. A female dragon named [[Delphyne]] ({{lang|grc|Δελφύνη}}; cf. {{lang|grc|δελφύς}}, &quot;womb&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|delfu/s|δελφύς|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a male serpent [[Typhon]] ({{lang|grc|Τυφῶν}}; from {{lang|grc|τύφειν}}, &quot;to smoke&quot;), the adversary of [[Zeus]] in the [[Titanomachy]], who the narrators confused with [[Python (mythology)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Many pictures show the serpent Python living in amity with Apollo and guarding the Omphalos. Karl Kerenyi (1951). ed. 1980: ''The gods of the Greeks'', pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In a Pompeian fresco Python is lying peacefully on the ground and the priests with the sacred double axe in their hand bring the bull (''bouphronion''). Jane. H. Harisson (1912): ''Themis. A study of the social origins of the Greek religion''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 423–424&lt;/ref&gt; Python was the good [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]] (ἀγαθὸς δαίμων) of the temple as it appears in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] religion,&lt;ref&gt;In Minoan religion the serpent is the protector of the household (underground stored corn). Also in Greek religion, &quot;snake of the house&quot; ({{lang|grc|οἰκουρὸς ὄφις}}) in the temple of [[Athena]] at Acropolis, etc., and in Greek folklore. Martin Nilsson, Vol.I, pp. 213–214&lt;/ref&gt; but she was represented as a dragon, as often happens in Northern European folklore as well as in the East.&lt;ref&gt;Nordig sagas. [[Hittites|Hittite]] myth of [[Illuyankas]]. Also in the Bible: [[Leviathan]]. W. Porzig (1930).'' Illuyankas and Typhon. Kleinasiatische Forschung'', pp. 379–386&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo and his sister [[Artemis]] can bring death with their arrows. The conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings, or magicians is common in [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] and [[Norse mythology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 541&quot;/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]] Artemis was the leader ({{lang|grc|ἡγεμών}}, &quot;hegemon&quot;) of the [[nymphs]], who had similar functions with the [[Norse mythology|Nordic]] [[Elf|Elves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nilsson499&quot;&gt;. Martin Nilsson (1967), Vol I, pp. 499–500&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;elf-shot&quot; originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves, but it was later attested denoting stone [[arrow (weapon)|arrow]]-heads which were used by witches to harm people, and also for healing rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Alaric. 2005. 'Getting Shot of Elves: Healing, Witchcraft and Fairies in the Scottish Witchcraft Trials', [http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/5597/], 116 (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;19–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vedic]] [[Rudra]] has some similar functions with Apollo. The terrible god is called &quot;the archer&quot; and the bow is also an attribute of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;For {{IAST|Śarva}} as a name of Shiva see: Apte, p.&amp;nbsp;910.&lt;/ref&gt; Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them and his alternative Shiva is a healer physician god.&lt;ref&gt;For association between Rudra and disease, with Rigvedic references, see: Bhandarkar, p.&amp;nbsp;146.&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] component of Apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens, exorcisms, and with the oracular cult.

===Minoan origin===
[[File:AMI - Goldene Doppelaxt.jpg|thumb|250px|Ornamented golden [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[labrys]]]]
It seems an oracular cult existed in Delphi from the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] age.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 8.80&lt;/ref&gt; In historical times, the priests of Delphi were called [[labrys|Lab(r)yadai]], &quot;the double-axe men&quot;, which indicates [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] origin. The double-axe, [[labrys]], was the holy symbol of the [[Crete|Cretan]] [[labyrinth]].&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1975). ''Cretan Paewones. Roman and Byzantine studies'', pp.&amp;nbsp;129–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.G.Wunderlich. ''The secret of Creta'' Souvenir Press Ltd. London p.&amp;nbsp;319&lt;/ref&gt; The Homeric hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices. ''Apollo Delphinios'' or ''Delphidios'' was a sea-god especially worshiped in Crete and in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol&amp;nbsp;I, p.&amp;nbsp;554 A4&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's sister [[Artemis]], who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with [[Britomartis]] ([[Diktynna]]), the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] &quot;Mistress of the animals&quot;. In her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the &quot;Master of the animals&quot;, a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute. His original name is unknown, but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular Apollo, who stood by the virgin &quot;Mistress of the Animals&quot;, becoming her brother.&lt;ref name=Nilsson499/&gt;

The old oracles in Delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the temple. This led some scholars to the conclusion that Pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries, according to the local tradition. In that regard, the mythical seeress [[Sibyl]] of [[Anatolia]]n origin, with her ecstatic art, looks unrelated to the oracle itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Bowden (2005). ''Classical Athens and the Delphic oracle'', pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves, which seem to be confirmed by recent studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = William J. Broad| title = The oracle: the lost secrets and hidden message of ancient Delphi| year = 2006| publisher = Penguin Group USA| isbn = 978-1-59420-081-6| page = 32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] describes the priestesses of Delphi and [[Dodona]] as frenzied women, obsessed by &quot;[[mania]]&quot; ({{lang|grc|μανία}}, &quot;frenzy&quot;), a Greek word he connected with ''mantis'' ({{lang|grc|μάντις}}, &quot;prophet&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ma/ntis|μάντις|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Frenzied women like Sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the [[Near East]] as [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in the second millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert (1985).''The Greek religion''. p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Although Crete had contacts with Mari from 2000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;F.Schachermeyer (1964). p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the Minoan and Mycenean ages. It is more probable that this art was introduced later from [[Anatolia]] and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to Delphi and dormant in several areas of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, pp. 543–545&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anatolian origin===
[[File:Coin of Apollo Agyieus.png|thumb|250px|Illustration of a coin of Apollo Agyieus from [[Ambracia]]]]
A non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot;/&gt; The name of Apollo's mother [[Leto]] has [[Lydia]]n origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of [[Asia Minor]]. The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from [[Anatolia]], which is the origin of [[Sibyl]], and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old [[Assyria|Assyro]]-[[Babylon]]ian texts, and these rituals were spread into the empire of the [[Hittites]]. In a Hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a Babylonian priestess for a certain &quot;purification&quot;.&lt;ref name=Nilsson563/&gt;

A similar story is mentioned by [[Plutarch]]. He writes that the [[Creta]]n [[prophet|seer]] [[Epimenides]] purified [[Athens]] after the pollution brought by the [[Alcmeonidae]] and that the seer's expertise in [[sacrifice]]s and reform of funeral practices were of great help to [[Solon]] in his reform of the Athenian state.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Solon'', 12; [[Aristotle]], ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Ath. Pol]]''. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The story indicates that Epimenides was probably heir to the [[Shamanism#Asia|shamanic religions of Asia]] and proves, together with the [[Homeric]] hymn, that Crete had a resisting religion up to historical times. It seems that these rituals were dormant in Greece and they were reinforced when the Greeks migrated to [[Anatolia]].

[[Homer]] pictures Apollo on the side of the [[Troy|Trojans]], fighting against the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]], during the [[Trojan War]]. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods. The god seems to be related to ''Appaliunas'', a tutelary god of [[Wilusa]] ([[Troy]]) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kretschmer]] (1936). Glotta XXIV p. 250. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt; The stones found in front of the gates of [[Homer]]ic Troy were the symbols of Apollo. A western Anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of ''Artimus'' ([[Artemis]]) and ''Qλdãns'', whose name may be cognate with the Hittite and Doric forms, in surviving [[Lydian language|Lydian]] texts''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ediana.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/corpus.php|title=EDIANA - Corpus|website=www.ediana.gwi.uni-muenchen.de|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of ''Qλdãns'' with Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sardisexpedition.org/en/essays/latw-greenewalt-gods-of-lydia|title=The Archaeological Exploration of Sardis|website=sardisexpedition.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks gave to him the name {{lang|grc|ἀγυιεύς}} ''[[agyieus]]'' as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion.'' vol. I (C. H. Beck), 1955:563f.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the [[full moon]], all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (''sibutu'') indicates a [[Babylonia]]n origin.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Late Bronze Age]] (from 1700 to 1200 BCE) [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Hurrian]] ''Aplu'' was a god of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], invoked during plague years. Here we have an [[apotrope|apotropaic]] situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it. Aplu, meaning ''the son of'', was a title given to the god [[Nergal]], who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun [[Shamash]].&lt;ref name=Grummond /&gt; Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god ({{lang|grc|δεινὸς θεός}}) who brings death and disease with his arrows, but who can also heal, possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I. pp. 559–560.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Iliad]]'', his priest prays to ''Apollo Smintheus'',&lt;ref&gt;&quot;You Apollo Smintheus, let my tears become your arrows against the Danaans, for revenge&quot;. [[Iliad]] 1.33 (A 33).&lt;/ref&gt; the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats.&lt;ref name=LSJsmintheus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An ancient aetiological myth connects ''sminthos'' with mouse and suggests Cretan origin. Apollo is the mouse-god (Strabo 13.1.48).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sminthia&quot; in several areas of Greece. In [[Rhodes]] (Lindos) they belong to Apollo and Dionysos who have destroyed the rats that were swallowing the grapes&quot;. Martin Nilsson (1967). pp. 534–535.&lt;/ref&gt; All these functions, including the function of the healer-god [[Paean (god)|Paean]], who seems to have Mycenean origin, are fused in the cult of Apollo.

==Oracular cult==
[[File:Columns of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece.jpeg|thumb|250px|Columns of the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] at Delphi, Greece]]
[[File:Herakles tripod Louvre F341.jpg|thumb|250px|Oracular tripod.]] 
Unusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: [[Delos]] and [[Delphi]]. In cult practice, [[Delos|Delian Apollo]] and [[Pythian Apollo]] (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985:143.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lycia]] was sacred to the god, for this Apollo was also called Lycian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/133#5.77.5 Diodorus Siculus, Library 1-7, 5.77.5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.77 Diodorus Siculus, Library 1-7, 5.77.5 - GR]&lt;/ref&gt;
Apollo's [[Cult (religion)|cult]] was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE. Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]], and the frequency of [[theophoric names]] such as ''Apollodorus'' or ''Apollonios'' and cities named ''Apollonia'' testify to his popularity. Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites. In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at [[Didyma]] and [[Claros]] pronounced the so-called &quot;theological oracles&quot;, in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an [[Monism#Monism, pantheism, and panentheism|all-encompassing, highest deity]]. &quot;In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent. [[Julian the Apostate]] (359–361) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot;/&gt;

===Oracular shrines===
[[File:Delos lions.jpg|thumb|250px|Delos lions]]
Apollo had a famous [[oracle]] in Delphi, and other notable ones in [[Claros]] and [[Didyma]]. His oracular shrine in [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]], where he bore the [[toponym]]ic epithet ''[[Abaeus]]'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων Ἀβαῖος}}, ''Apollon Abaios''), was important enough to be consulted by [[Croesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], 1.46.&lt;/ref&gt;
His oracular shrines include:

* [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]].
* [[Bassae]] in the [[Peloponnese]].
* At [[Clarus]], on the west coast of [[Asia Minor]]; as at Delphi a holy spring which gave off a ''pneuma'', from which the priests drank.
* In [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], the Oracle of Corinth came from the town of [[Tenea]], from prisoners supposedly taken in the Trojan War.
* At [[Khyrse]], in [[Troad]], the temple was built for Apollo Smintheus.
* In [[Delos]], there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo, during summer. The Hieron (Sanctuary) of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake, was the place where the god was said to have been born.
* In [[Delphi]], the [[Pythia]] became filled with the ''[[pneuma]]'' of Apollo, said to come from a spring inside the [[Adyton]].
* In [[Didyma]], an oracle on the coast of [[Anatolia]], south west of [[Lydia]]n ([[Luwian]]) [[Sardis]], in which priests from the lineage of the Branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple. Was believed to have been founded by [[Branchus]], son or lover of Apollo.
* In [[Manbij|Hierapolis Bambyce]], Syria (modern Manbij), according to the treatise ''[[De Dea Syria]]'', the sanctuary of the [[Atargatis|Syrian Goddess]] contained a robed and bearded image of Apollo. Divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian]] (attrib.), ''[[De Dea Syria]]'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/tsg/tsg07.htm#35 35–37].&lt;/ref&gt;
* At [[Patara (Lycia)|Patara]], in [[Lycia]], there was a seasonal winter oracle of Apollo, said to have been the place where the god went from Delos. As at Delphi the oracle at Patara was a woman.
* In [[Segesta]] in Sicily.

Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo.
* In [[Oropus]], north of [[Athens]], the oracle [[Amphiaraus]], was said to be the son of Apollo; Oropus also had a sacred spring.
* in Labadea, {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Delphi, [[Trophonius]], another son of Apollo, killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle.

==Temples of Apollo==
{{Main|Ancient Greek temple|Roman temple}}

Many temples were dedicated to Apollo in Greece and the Greek colonies. They show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of the Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in [[Crete]], do not belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered [[divinity|divine]], and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of [[Doric order]]. The Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection.&lt;ref&gt;To know what a thing is, we must know the look of it&quot;: Rhys Carpenter: ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of [[Pythagoras]], who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics.&lt;ref name=&quot;C. M. Bowra 1957 p. 166&quot;&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957). ''The Greek experience'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Doric order]] dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which couldn't be solved without changing the original forms. The order was almost abandoned for the [[Ionic order]], but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple. Both orders were abandoned for the [[Corinthian order]] gradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome.

The most important temples are:

===Greek temples===
*[[Thebes, Greece]]: The oldest temple probably dedicated to ''Apollo Ismenius'' was built in the 9th century B.C. It seems that it was a curvilinear building. The [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built in the early 7th century B.C., but only some small parts have been found&lt;ref&gt;William Dinsmoor (1950),''The architecture of Ancient Greece'', p. 218, {{ISBN|0-8196-0283-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival called [[Daphnephoria]] was celebrated every ninth year in honour of Apollo Ismenius (or Galaxius). The people held laurel branches (daphnai), and at the head of the procession walked a youth (chosen priest of Apollo), who was called &quot;daphnephoros&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;William Smith 1875. p. 384&quot;&gt;William Smith.'' A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', John Murray, London, 1875. p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Eretria]]: According to the Homeric hymn to Apollo, the god arrived to the plain, seeking for a location to establish its oracle. The first temple of ''Apollo Daphnephoros'', &quot;Apollo, laurel-bearer&quot;, or &quot;carrying off Daphne&quot;, is dated to 800 B.C. The temple was curvilinear ''hecatombedon'' (a hundred feet). In a smaller building were kept the bases of the laurel branches which were used for the first building. Another temple probably peripteral was built in the 7th century B.C., with an inner row of wooden columns over its Geometric predecessor. It was rebuilt peripteral around 510 B.C., with the [[stylobate]] measuring 21,00 x 43,00 m. The number of [[pteron]] column was 6 x 14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1689 Hellenic Ministry of culture, Temple of Apollo Daphnephoros] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912212901/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1689 |date=12 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rufus B. Richardson, &quot;A Temple in Eretria&quot; ''The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts'', '''10'''.3 (July – September 1895:326–337)&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Dreros]] ([[Crete]]). The temple of ''Apollo Delphinios'' dates from the 7th century B.C., or probably from the middle of the 8th century B.C. According to the legend, Apollo appeared as a dolphin, and carried Cretan priests to the port of [[Delphi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 529&quot;&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol&amp;nbsp;I, p.&amp;nbsp;529&lt;/ref&gt; The dimensions of the plan are 10,70 x 24,00 m and the building was not peripteral. It contains column-bases of the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] type, which may be considered as the predecessors of the [[Doric order|Doric]] columns.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson pp. 56 and 323&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gortyn]] ([[Crete]]). A temple of ''Pythian Apollo'', was built in the 7th century B.C. The plan measured 19,00 x 16,70 m and it was not peripteral. The walls were solid, made from limestone, and there was single door on the east side.
*[[Thermon]] ([[West Greece]]): The [[Doric order|Doric]] temple of ''Apollo Thermios'', was built in the middle of the 7th century B.C. It was built on an older curvilinear building dating perhaps from the 10th century B.C., on which a [[peristyle]] was added. The temple was narrow, and the number of pteron columns (probably wooden) was 5 x 15. There was a single row of inner columns. It measures 12.13 x 38.23 m at the stylobate, which was made from stones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spivey, p. 112&quot;&gt;Spivey, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Apollotempel.gif|thumb|left|200px| Floor plan of the temple of Apollo, Corinth]] 
*[[Corinth]]: A [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built in the 6th century B.C. The temple's [[stylobate]] measures 21.36 x 53.30 m, and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 15. There was a double row of inner columns. The style is similar with the Temple of Alcmeonidae at [[Delphi]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The Corinthians were considered to be the inventors of the [[Doric order]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spivey, p. 112&quot;/&gt; 
*Napes ([[Lesbos]]): An [[Aeolic order|Aeolic]] temple probably of ''Apollo Napaios'' was built in the 7th century B.C. Some special capitals with floral ornament have been found, which are called [[Aeolic order|Aeolic]], and it seems that they were borrowed from the East.&lt;ref name=Robertson324&gt;D.S Robertson(1945):''A handbook of Greek and Roman architecture'', Cambridge University Press pp. 324-329&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Cyrene, Libya]]: The oldest [[Doric order|Doric]] temple of Apollo was built in c. 600 B.C. The number of pteron columns was 6 x 11, and it measures 16.75 x 30.05 m at the stylobate. There was a double row of sixteen inner columns on stylobates. The capitals were made from stone.&lt;ref name=Robertson324/&gt; 
*[[Naukratis]]: An [[Ionic order|Ionic]] temple was built in the early 6th century B.C. Only some fragments have been found and the earlier, made from limestone, are identified among the oldest of the [[Ionic order]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siracusa-Temple-of-Apoll-Plan-bjs.png|thumb|right|200px|Floor plan of the temple of Apollo, Syracuse]]
*[[Syracuse, Sicily]]: A [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built at the beginning of the 6th century B.C. The temple's [[stylobate]] measures 21.47 x 55.36 m and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 17. It was the first temple in Greek west built completely out of stone. A second row of columns were added, obtaining the effect of an inner porch.&lt;ref&gt;Mertens 2006, pp. 104–109.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Selinus]] ([[Sicily]]):The [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Temple C (Selinus)|Temple C]] dates from 550 B.C., and it was probably dedicated to Apollo. The temple's stylobate measures 10.48 x 41.63 m and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 17. There was portico with a second row of columns, which is also attested for the temple at [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Inscriptiones Graecorum|IG]] XIV 269&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Delphi]]: The first temple dedicated to Apollo, was built in the 7th century B.C. According to the legend, it was wooden made of laurel branches. The &quot;Temple of Alcmeonidae&quot; was built in c. 513 B.C. and it is the oldest Doric temple with significant marble elements. The temple's stylobate measures 21.65 x 58.00 m, and the number of pteron columns as 6 x 15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/delphi-temple-of-apollo.html Temple of Apollo at Delphi], Ancient-Greece.org&lt;/ref&gt; A fest similar with Apollo's fest at [[Thebes, Greece]] was celebrated every nine years.

The maidens participated with joyful songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;William Smith 1875. p. 384&quot;/&gt; 
*[[Chios]]: An [[Ionic order|Ionic]] temple of ''Apollo Phanaios'' was built at the end of the 6th century B.C. Only some small parts have been found and the capitals had floral ornament.&lt;ref name=Robertson324/&gt; 
*[[Abae]] ([[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocis]]). The temple was destroyed by the [[Persia]]ns in the invasion of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] in 480 B.C., and later by the [[Boeotia]]ns.

*[[Bassae]] ([[Peloponnesus]]):A temple dedicated to ''Apollo Epikourios'' (&quot;Apollo the helper&quot;), was built in 430 B.C. and it was designed by [[Iktinos]].It combined [[Doric order|Doric]] and [[Ionic order|Ionic]] elements, and the earliest use of column with a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capital in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=6664 Hellenic Ministry of Culture: The Temple of Epicurean Apollo].&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is of a relatively modest size, with the [[stylobate]] measuring 14.5 x 38.3 metres&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;&gt;[http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/apolloepicurius.html Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae], World Heritage Site.&lt;/ref&gt; containing a [[Doric order|Doric]] [[peristyle]] of 6 x 15 columns. The roof left a central space open to admit light and air.
*[[Delos]]: A temple probably dedicated to Apollo and not peripteral, was built in the late 7th century B.C., with a plan measuring 10,00 x 15,60 m. The [[Doric order|Doric]] Great temple of Apollo, was built in c. 475 B.C. The temple's stylobate measures 13.72 x 29.78 m, and the number of pteron columns as 6 x 13.

*[[Pompeii]] (Italy): The cult of Apollo was widespread in the region of Campania since the 6th century B.C. The temple was built in 120 B.V, but its beginnings lie in the 6th century B.C. It was reconstructed after an earthquake in A.D. 63. It demonstrates a mixing of styles which formed the basis of Roman architecture. The columns in front of the cella formed a [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] prostyle porch, and the cella is situated unusually far back. The peripteral colonnade of 48 [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns was placed in such a way that the emphasis was given to the front side.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson CSA :[http://sites.davidson.edu/csa/the-temple-of-apollo-at-pompeii-a-mishmash-of-architecture/ Temple of Apollo, Pompeii] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106221543/http://sites.davidson.edu/csa/the-temple-of-apollo-at-pompeii-a-mishmash-of-architecture/ |date=6 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
{{Main|Greek mythology}}
Apollo appears often in the myths, plays and hymns. As Zeus' favorite son, Apollo had direct access to the mind of Zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans. A divinity beyond human comprehension, he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god.

===Birth===
[[File:Metropolitan Richart Latona.jpg|thumb|Leto with her children, by William Henry Rinehart]]

Apollo was the son of Zeus, the king of the gods, and Leto, his previous wife&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' 21.499&lt;/ref&gt; or one of his mistresses. Growing up, Apollo was nursed by the nymphs Korythalia and [[Aletheia (disambiguation)|Aletheia]], the personification of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Moralia'' 657e&lt;/ref&gt;

When Zeus' wife [[Hera]] discovered that [[Leto]] was pregnant, she banned Leto from giving birth on ''[[Solid Earth|terra firma]]''. Leto sought shelter in many lands, only to be rejected by them. Finally, the voice of unborn Apollo informed his mother about a floating island named [[Delos]] which had once been [[Asteria (Titaness)|Asteria]], Leto's own sister.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callimachus, Hymn to Delos&quot;&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Delos''&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was neither a mainland nor an island, Leto was readily welcomed there and gave birth to her children under a palm tree. All the goddesses except Hera were present to witness the event. It is also stated that Hera kidnapped [[Eileithyia]], the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards or 8.2 meters long.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Hymn to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Latona with Her Children Apollo and Diana LACMA M.78.86.jpg|thumb|Leto holding Apollo, by Lazar Widmann]]
When Apollo was born, clutching a golden sword,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Works and Days|last=Hesiod|date=2007|doi=10.4159/dlcl.hesiod-works_days.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; everything on Delos turned into gold&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Delos''&lt;/ref&gt; and the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance.&lt;ref&gt;Theognis, Fragment 1. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Swans circled the island seven times and the nymphs sang in delight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callimachus, Hymn to Delos&quot;/&gt; He was washed clean by the goddesses who then covered him in white garment and fastened golden bands around him. Since Leto was unable to feed the him, [[Themis]], the goddess of divine law, fed him with nectar, or [[ambrosia]]. Upon tasting the divine food, Apollo broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of [[lyre]] and archery, and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Homeric hymn to Apollo&quot;&gt;Homer, ''hymn to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt; Zeus, who had calmed Hera by the time, came and adorned his son with a golden headband.&lt;ref&gt;Alcaeus, ''Hymn to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Himerius, ''Oration''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Latona with the infants Apollo and Artemis, by Francesco Pozzi, 1824, marble - Sculpture Gallery, Chatsworth House - Derbyshire, England - DSC03504.jpg|thumb|Leto with Apollo and Artemis, by Francesco Pozzi]]

Apollo's birth fixed the floating Delos to the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, 
''Hymn to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt; Leto promised that her son would be always favorable towards the Delians. According to some, Apollo secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean after some time.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' 3.80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca''&lt;/ref&gt; This island became sacred to Apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god.

Apollo was born on the seventh day ({{lang|grc|ἑβδομαγενής}}, ''hebdomagenes'')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e(bdomagenh/s|ἑβδομαγενής|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the month [[Attic calendar#Festival calendar|Thargelion]] —according to Delian tradition—or of the month [[Hellenic calendars#Delphic|Bysios]]—according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=184}} Mythographers agree that [[Artemis]] was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo, or that Artemis was born on the island of [[Ortygia]] and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo.

===Hyperborea===

[[Hyperborea]], the mystical land of eternal spring, venerated Apollo above all the gods. The Hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted [[Pythian games]].&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, Pindar, Olympian Ode&lt;/ref&gt; There, a vast forest of beautiful trees was called &quot;the garden of Apollo&quot;. Apollo spent the winter months among the Hyperboreans.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 2. 674&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Callimachus, Hymn to Apollo&quot;&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt; His absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death. No prophecies were issued during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Joseph Eddy Fontenrose, ''Python: A Study of Delphic Myth and Its Origins''&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the world during the beginning of the spring. The ''Theophania'' festival was held in [[Delphi]] to celebrate his return.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''de his qui sero a num. pun.'' p557F&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that Leto came to Delos from Hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves. Henceforth, Hyperborea became Apollo's winter home and wolves became sacred to him. His intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet ''Lyceus'', meaning ''wolf-like''. But Apollo was also the wolf-slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators. The Hyperborean worship of Apollo bears the strongest marks of Apollo being worshipped as the sun god. Shamanistic elements in Apollo's cult are often liked to his Hyperborean origin, and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Afonasina, ''Shamanism and the Orphic tradition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Graf, ''Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt; Shamans like [[Abaris]] and [[Aristeas]] were also the followers of Apollo, who hailed from Hyperborea.

In myths, the tears of amber Apollo shed when his son Asclepius died became the waters of the river Eridanos, which surrounded Hyperborea. Apollo also buried in Hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the [[Cyclopes]]. He later gave this arrow to Abaris.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius Rhodius, ''Argonautica'' 4. 594&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood and youth===

As a child, Apollo is said to have built a foundation and an altar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted. Since he learnt the art of building when young, he later came to be known as [[Archegetes]], ''the founder (of towns)&quot; and god who guided men to build new cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callimachus, Hymn to Apollo&quot;/&gt; From his father Zeus, Apollo had also received a golden chariot drawn by swans.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy P. Bridgman 
 ''Hyperboreans: Myth and History in Celtic-Hellenic Contacts''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Flaxman - To Phoebus at His Birth, From Aeschylus, Furies - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]] gifts the oracular tripod to Apollo, by John Flaxman]]

In his early years when Apollo spent his time herding cows, he was reared by [[Thriae]], the bee nymphs, who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills.&lt;ref&gt;Homeric Hymn 4 to Hermes 550&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo is also said to have invented the lyre, and along with Artemis, the art of archery. He then taught to the humans the art of healing and archery.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, ''Library of history'' 5.74.5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]], his grandmother, gave the oracular shrine of [[Delphi]] to Apollo as a birthday gift. Themis inspired him to be the oracular voice of Delphi thereon.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschylus, ''Eumenides'' 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orphic Hymn 79 to Themis&lt;/ref&gt;

====Python====
[[File:Leto (Latona). - Engravings on Wood.jpg|thumb|Python pursuing Leto and her children, engravings on wood]]

[[Python (mythology)|Python]], a [[chthonic]] serpent-dragon, was a child of Gaea and the guardian of the [[Delphic Oracle]], whose death was foretold by Apollo when he was still in Leto's womb.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callimachus, Hymn to Apollo&quot;/&gt; Python was the nurse of the giant [[Typhon]].&lt;ref&gt;''Homeric hymn to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the traditions, Apollo was still a child when he killed Python.

Python was sent by Hera to hunt the pregnant Leto to death, and had assaulted her. To avenge the trouble given to his mother, Apollo went in search of Python and killed it in the sacred cave at Delphi with the bow and arrows that he had received from [[Hephaestus]]. The Delphian nymphs who were present encouraged Apollo during the battle with the cry &quot;Hie [[Paean]]&quot;. After Apollo was victorious, they also brought him gifts and gave the [[Corycian cave]] to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Children of the Gods'' by [[Kenneth McLeish]], page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Homer, Apollo had encountered and killed the Python when he was looking for a place to establish his shrine.

According to another version, when Leto was in Delphi, Python had attacked her. Apollo defended his mother and killed Python.&lt;ref&gt;Euripides Iphigenia in Tauris&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euripides]] in his ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]'' gives an account of his fight with Python and the events aftermath. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;You killed him, o Phoebus, while still a baby, still leaping in the arms of your dear mother, and you entered the holy shrine, and sat on the golden tripod, on your truthful throne distributing prophecies from the gods to mortals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A detailed account of Apollo's conflict with Gaea and Zeus' intervention on behalf of his young son is also given. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;But when Apollo came and sent Themis, the child of Earth, away from the holy oracle of Pytho, Earth gave birth to dream visions of the night; and they told to the cities of men the present, and what will happen in the future, through dark beds of sleep on the ground; and so Earth took the office of prophecy away from Phoebus, in envy, because of her daughter. The lord made his swift way to Olympus and wound his baby hands around Zeus, asking him to take the wrath of the earth goddess from the Pythian home. Zeus smiled, that the child so quickly came to ask for worship that pays in gold. He shook his locks of hair, put an end to the night voices, and took away from mortals the truth that appears in darkness, and gave the privilege back again to Loxias.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Apollo also demanded that all other methods of divination be made inferior to his, a wish that Zeus granted him readily. Because of this, Athena, who had been practicing divination by throwing pebbles, cast her pebbles away in displeasure.&lt;ref&gt;John Opsopaus, ''The Oracles of Apollo: Practical Ancient Greek Divination for Today''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo Killing the Python LACMA 54.70.1i.jpg|thumb|Apollo killing the Python, by Hendrik Goltzius]]

However, Apollo had committed a blood murder and had to be purified. Because Python was a child of [[Gaea]], Gaea wanted Apollo to be banished to Tartarus as a punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar's Paeans: A Reading of the Fragments with a Survey of the Genre&lt;/ref&gt; Zeus didn't agree and instead exiled his son from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], and instructed him to get purified. Apollo had to serve as a slave for nine years.&lt;ref&gt;John Lemprière, ''Bibliotheca Classica''&lt;/ref&gt; After the servitude was over, as per his father's order, he travelled to the [[Vale of Tempe]] to bath in waters of [[Pineios (Thessaly)|Peneus]].&lt;ref&gt;The Uses of Greek Mythology
By Ken Dowden&lt;/ref&gt; There Zeus himself performed purificatory rites on Apollo. Purified, Apollo was escorted by his half sister [[Athena]] to Delphi where the oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by Gaea.&lt;ref&gt;Aristonous: Paean To Apollo&lt;/ref&gt; According to a variation, Apollo had also travelled to Crete, where [[Carmanor (of Crete)|Carmanor]] purified him. Apollo later established the [[Pythian games]] to appropriate Gaea. Henceforth, Apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder and, made men aware of their guilt and purified them.&lt;ref&gt;Apollo, Fritz Graf&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, Zeus instructed Apollo to go to Delphi and establish his law. But Apollo, disobeying his father, went to the land of [[Hyperborea]] and stayed there for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy P. Bridgman, ''Hyperboreans: Myth and History in Celtic-Hellenic Contacts''&lt;/ref&gt; He returned only after the Delphians sang hymns to him and pleaded him to come back. Zeus, pleased with his son's integrity, gave Apollo the seat next to him on his right side. He also gave to Apollo various gifts, like a golden tripod, a golden bow and arrows, a golden chariot and the city of Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Acosta-Hughes, Luigi Lehnus, Susan Stephens - ''Brill's Companion to Callimachus''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:7003.Apollo mit dem getöteten Python(1752)-François Gaspard Adam-Große Fontäne-Sanssouci Steffen Heilfort.JPG|thumb|Apollo victorious over the Python, by François Gaspard Adam]]

Soon after his return, Apollo needed to recruit people to Delphi. So, when he spotted a ship sailing from Crete, he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin. The crew was awed into submission and followed a course that led the ship to Delphi. There Apollo revealed himself as a god. Initiating them to his service, he instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts. The [[Pythia]] was Apollo's high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies. Pythia is arguably the constant favorite of Apollo among the mortals.

====Tityos====
[[File:Apollo Tityos Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2689.jpg|thumb|Apollo slaying [[Tityos]], Attic red-figure kylix, 460–450 BC]]

Hera once again sent another giant, [[Tityos]] to rape Leto. This time Apollo shot him with his arrows and attacked him with his golden sword. According to other version, Artemis also aided him in protecting their mother by attacking Tityos with her arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Scholia on [[Pindar]], ''Pythian Odes'' 4.160 citing Pherecydes&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to [[Tartarus]]. There, he was pegged to the rock floor, covering an area of {{convert|9|acre|m2}}, where a pair of [[vulture]]s feasted daily on his liver.

===Admetus===
[[File:Drawing, Apollo Guards the Herds (or Flocks) of King Admetus, 1780–1800 (CH 18122047).jpg|thumb|Apollo Guards the Herds (or Flocks) of King [[Admetus]], by Felice Gianni]]

[[Admetus]] was the king of [[Pherae]], who was known for his hospitality. When Apollo was exiled from Olympus for killing Python, he served as a herdsman under Admetus, who was then young and unmarried. Apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with Admetus during his stay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callimachus hymn to Apollo&quot;&gt;[[Callimachus]]: ''[https://www.theoi.com/Text/CallimachusHymns1.html Hymn to Apollo]''&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his years of servitude, Apollo went back to Olympus as a god.

Because Admetus had treated Apollo well, the god conferred great benefits on him in return. Apollo's mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins.&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-3-10-4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Callimachus hymn to Apollo&quot; /&gt; Apollo helped Admetus win the hand of [[Alcestis]], the daughter of [[Pelias|King Pelias]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-1-9-15&quot;&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]], [https://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html Bibliotheca] 1.9.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hyginus-50&quot;&gt;[[Hyginus]], [https://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html Fabulae] 50-51&lt;/ref&gt; by taming a lion and a boar to draw Admetus' chariot. He was present during their wedding to give his blessings. When Admetus angered the goddess Artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings, Apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister.&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-1-9-15&quot; /&gt; When Apollo learnt of Admetus' untimely death, he convinced or tricked the [[Moirai|Fates]] into letting Admetus live past his time.&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-1-9-15&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hyginus-50&quot; /&gt;

According to another version, or perhaps some years later, when Zeus struck down Apollo's son [[Asclepius]] with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead, Apollo in revenge killed the [[Cyclopes]], who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus.&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-3-10-4&quot;&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[https://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus3.html#10 Bibliotheca]'' III.10.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo would have been banished to [[Tartarus]] for this, but his mother [[Leto]] intervened, and reminding Zeus of their old love, pleaded him not to kill their son. Zeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year of [[Penal labour|hard labor]] once again under Admetus.&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-3-10-4&quot; /&gt;

The love between Apollo and Admetus was a favored topic of Roman poets like [[Ovid]] and [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]].

===Niobe===
[[File:Pierre-Charles Jombert - Les enfants de Niobé tués par Apollon et Diane.JPG|thumb|250px|''Niobe's children are killed by Apollo and Diana'' by [[Pierre-Charles Jombert]]]]

The fate of [[Niobe]] was prophesied by Apollo while he was still in Leto's womb.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callimachus hymn to Apollo&quot;/&gt; Niobe was the queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]]. She displayed [[hubris]] when she boasted that she was superior to Leto because she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. She further mocked Apollo's effeminate appearance and Artemis' manly appearance. Leto, insulted by this, told her children to punish Niobe. Accordingly, Apollo killed Niobe's sons, and Artemis her daughters. According to some versions of the myth, among the Niobids, Chloris and her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.

A devastated Niobe fled to [[Spil Mount|Mount Sipylos]] in [[Asia Minor]] and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river [[Achelous]]. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.

When Chloris married and had children, Apollo granted her son [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] the years he had taken away from the Niobids. Hence, Nestor was able to live for 3 generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building the walls of Troy ===

Once Apollo and [[Poseidon]] served under the Trojan king [[Laomedon]] in accordance to Zeus' words. Apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of mount Ida, while Poseidon built the walls of Troy.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''The Iliad'' 21.434&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions make both Apollo and Poseidon the builders of the wall. In Ovid's account, Apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre.

In [[Pindar]]'s odes, the gods took a mortal named [[Aeacus]] as their assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Olympian Odes'' viii. 39, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; When the work was completed, three snakes rushed against the wall, and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead, the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by Aeacus. Apollo immediately prophesied that [[Troy]] would fall at the hands of Aeacus's descendants, the [[Aeacidae]] (i.e. his son Telamon joined [[Heracles]] when he sieged the city during Laomedon's rule. Later, his great grandson [[Neoptolemus]] was present in the wooden horse that lead to the downfall of Troy).

[[File:Sandrart (attributed), Troppa (attr.) - Laomedon Refusing Payment to Poseidon and Apollo - 17th c.jpg|thumb|Laomedon Refusing Payment to Poseidon and Apollo, by [[Joachim von Sandrart]]]]

However, the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised, but also threatened to bind their feet and hands, and sell them as slaves. Angered by the unpaid labour and the insults, Apollo infected the city with a pestilence and Posedion sent the sea monster [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. To deliver the city from it, Laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter [[Hesione]] (who would later be saved by [[Heracles]]).

During his stay in Troy, Apollo had a lover named Ourea, who was a nymph and daughter of Poseidon. Together they had a son named Ileus, whom Apollo loved dearly.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Catalogues of Women'' Fragment 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trojan War===

Apollo sided with the Trojans during the [[Trojan War]] waged by the Greeks against the Trojans.

During the war, the Greek king [[Agamemnon]] captured [[Chryseis]], the daughter of Apollo's priest [[Chryses]], and refused to return her. Angered by this, Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment. He demanded that they return the girl, and the Achaeans (Greeks) complied, indirectly causing the ''[[Achilles and Patroclus#In the Iliad|anger of Achilles]]'', which is the theme of the ''[[Iliad]]''.
 
[[File:John Flaxman - Apollo Preceding Hector with His Aegis, and Dispersing the Greeks, Fuseli's Lectures - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Apollo preceding [[Hector]] with his [[Aegis]], and dispersing the Greeks, by John Flaxman]]

Receiving the [[aegis]] from Zeus, Apollo entered the battlefield as per his father's command, causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry. He pushed the Greeks back and destroyed many of the soldiers. He is described as &quot;the rouser of armies&quot; because he rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart.

When Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war, Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel. However, Apollo declined to fight him, saying that he wouldn't fight his uncle for the sake of mortals.

[[File:Diomedes prevented by Apollo from pursuing Aeneas (?) MET 80355.jpg|thumb|Apollo prevents [[Diomedes]] from pursuing [[Aeneas]]]]

When the Greek hero [[Diomedes]] injured the Trojan hero [[Aeneas]], [[Aphrodite]] tried to rescue him, but Diomedes injured her as well. Apollo then enveloped Aeneas in a cloud to protect him. He repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain himself from attacking a god. Aeneas was then taken to Pergamos, a sacred spot in [[Troy]], where he was healed.

After the death of [[Sarpedon (Trojan War hero)|Sarpedon]], a son of Zeus, Apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father's wish and cleaned it. He then gave it to Sleep ([[Hypnos]]) and Death ([[Thanatos]]). Apollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that day, so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while.

[[File:Hector's body dragged at the Chariot of Achilles.jpg|thumb|Apollo protecting Hector's body, by John Flaxman]]
The Trojan hero [[Hector]] (who, according to some, was the god's own son by [[Hecuba]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Stesichorus]], Fr. 108; [[Tzetzes]], ''On Lycophron''  266; Porphyry in his ''Omissions'' states that [[Ibycus]], [[Alexander Aetolus|Alexander]], [[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]] and [[Lycophron]] all made Hector the son of Apollo.&lt;/ref&gt;) was favored by Apollo. When he got severely injured, Apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up his arms. During a duel with Achilles, when Hector was about to lose, Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him. When the Greek warrior [[Patroclus]] tried to get into the fort of Troy, he was stopped by Apollo. Encouraging Hector to attack Patroclus, Apollo stripped the armour of the Greek warrior and broke his weapons. Patroclus was eventually killed by Hector. At last, after Hector's fated death, Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles' attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse.
&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Achilles slaying Troilus.PNG|thumb|[[Achilles]] slaying [[Troilus]]]]

Apollo held a grudge against Achilles throughout the war because Achilles had murdered his son [[Tenes]] before the war began and brutally assassinated his son [[Troilus]] in his own temple. Not only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles, he also tricked Achilles by disguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates. He foiled Achilles' attempt to mutilate Hector's dead body.

Finally, Apollo caused Achilles' death by guiding an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] into [[Achilles]]' heel. In some versions, Apollo himself killed Achilles by taking the disguise of Paris.

Apollo helped many Trojan warriors, including [[Agenor]], [[Polydamas (mythology)|Polydamas]], [[Glaucus]] in the battlefield. Though he greatly favored the Trojans, Apollo was bound to follow the orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war.

===Heracles===

After [[Heracles]] (then named Alcides) was struck with madness and killed his family, he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of Apollo. Apollo, through the Pythia, commanded him to serve king [[Eurystheus]] for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him. Only then would Alcides be absolved of his sin. Apollo also renamed him as Heracles.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corinthian helmet Cdm Paris BB2013 n2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Heracles and Apollo struggling over the Hind, as depicted on a Corinthian helmet (early 5th century BC)]]

To complete his third task, Heracles had to capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]], a hind sacred to Artemis, and bring it alive. He chased the hind for one year. When the animal eventually got tired and tried crossing the river Ladon, he captured it. While he was taking it back, he was confronted by Apollo and Artemis, who were angered at Heracles for this act. However, Heracles soothed the goddess and explained his situation to her. After much pleading, Artemis permitted him to take the hind and told him to return it later.

[[File:Herakles tripod Louvre F341.jpg|thumb|Heracles steals Apollo's tripod, Attic black-figure oinochoe, ca. 520 BC.]]

After he was freed from his servitude to Eurystheus, Heracles fell in conflict with Iphytus, a prince of Oechalia, and murdered him. Soon after, he contracted a terrible disease. He consulted the oracle of Apollo once again, in hope of ridding himself of the disease. The Pythia, however, denied to give any prophesy. In anger, Heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started walking away, intending to start his own oracle. However, Apollo did not tolerate this and stopped Heracles; a duel ensued between them. Artemis rushed to support Apollo, while Athena supported Heracles. Soon, Zeus threw his thunderbolt between the fighting brothers and separated them. He reprimanded Heracles for this act of violation and asked Apollo to give a solution to Heracles. Apollo then ordered the hero to serve under [[Omphale]], queen of [[Lydia]] for one year in order to purify himself.

===Periphas===

[[Periphas]] was an Attican king and a priest of Apollo. He was noble, just and rich. He did all his duties justly. Because of this people were very fond of him and started honouring him to the same extent as Zeus. At one point, they worshipped Periphas in place of Zeus and set up shrines and temples for him. This annoyed Zeus, who decided to annihilate the entire family of Periphas. But because he was a just king and a good devotee, Apollo intervened and requested his father to spare Periphas. Zeus considered Apollo's words and agreed to let him live. But he metamorphosed Periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds. When Periphas' wife requested Zeus to let her stay with her husband, Zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish.&lt;ref&gt;Antoninus Liberalis, ''Metamorphoses'' 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato's concept of soulmates===

A long time ago, there were three kinds of human beings: male, descended from the sun; female, descended from the earth; and androgynous, descended from the moon. Each human being was completely round, with four arms and fours legs, two identical faces on opposite sides of a head with four ears, and all else to match. They were powerful and unruly. [[Aloadae|Otis]] and [[Aloadae|Ephialtes]] even dared to scale [[Mount Olympus]].

To check their insolence, Zeus devised a plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them. He cut them all in two and asked Apollo to make necessary repairs, giving humans the individual shape they still have now. Apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds, he pulled together their skin at the [[abdomen]], and sewed the skin together at the middle of it. This is what we call [[navel]] today. He smoothened the wrinkles and shaped the chest. But he made sure to leave a few wrinkles on the abdomen and around the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[The Symposium]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;As he [Zeus] cut them one after another, he bade Apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turn... Apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and compose their forms. So Apollo gave a turn to the face and pulled the skin from the sides all over that which in our language is called the belly, like the purses which draw in, and he made one mouth at the centre [of the belly] which he fastened in a knot (the same which is called the navel); he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles, much as a shoemaker might smooth leather upon a last; he left a few wrinkles, however, in the region of the belly and navel, as a memorial of the primeval state.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nurturer of the young===

Apollo ''Kourotrophos'' is the god who nurtures and protects children and the young, especially boys. He oversees their education and their passage into adulthood. Education is said to have originated from Apollo and the [[Muses]]. Many myths have him train his children. It was a custom for boys to cut and dedicate their long hair to Apollo after reaching adulthood.

[[Chiron]], the abandoned [[centaur]], was fostered by Apollo, who instructed him in medicine, prophecy, archery and more. Chiron would later become a great teacher himself.

[[Asclepius]] in his childhood gained much knowledge pertaining to medicinal arts by his father. However, he was later entrusted to Chiron for further education.

[[Anius]], Apollo's son by [[Rhoeo]], was abandoned by his mother soon after his birth. Apollo brought him up and educated him in mantic arts. Anius later became the priest of Apollo and the king of Delos.

[[Iamus]] was the son of Apollo and [[Evadne]]. When Evadne went into labour, Apollo sent the [[Moirai]] to assist his lover. After the child was born, Apollo sent snakes to feed the child some honey. When Iamus reached the age of education, Apollo took him to Olympia and taught him many arts, including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, Olympian Ode 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Idmon]] was educated by Apollo to be a seer. Even though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with the [[Argonauts]], he embraced his destiny and died a brave death. To commemorate his son's bravery, Apollo commanded Boetians to build a town around the tomb of the hero, and to honor him.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius Rhodius. Argonautica ii, 846 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo adopted [[Carnus]], the abandoned son of Zeus and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]]. He reared the child with the help of his mother Leto and educated him to be a seer.

When his son [[Melaneus of Oechalia|Melaneus]] reached the age of marriage, Apollo asked the princess [[Stratonice (mythology)|Stratonice]] to be his son's bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed.   
 
Apollo saved a shepherd boy (name unknown) from death in a large deep cave, by the means of vultures. To thank him, the shepherd built Apollo a temple under the name Vulturius.&lt;ref&gt;The Cyclopedia, Or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature, Volume 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===God of music===

Immediately after his birth, Apollo demanded a lyre and invented the [[paean]], thus becoming the god of music. As the divine singer, he is the patron of poets, singers and musicians. The invention of string music is attributed to him. [[Plato]] said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music, rhythm and harmony is the gift of Apollo and the Muses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''Laws'' 653.4&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Socrates]], ancient Greeks believed that Apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together, both for the gods and the humans. For this reason, he was called ''Homopolon'' before the ''Homo'' was replaced by ''A''.&lt;ref&gt;The prefix ''A'' means &quot;without&quot; or &quot;not&quot;, and ''polloi'' means &quot;many&quot;, thus ''Apollo'' means &quot;not many&quot; or &quot;united&quot;, referring to his ability to create harmony.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's harmonious music delivered people from their pain, and hence, like Dionysus, he is also called the liberator.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Callimachus]], ''Hymn to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt; The swans, which were considered to be the most musical among the birds, were believed to be the &quot;singers of Apollo&quot;. They are Apollo's sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to [[Hyperborea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] says that when the singers would sing hymns to Apollo, the swans would join the chant in unison.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On the nature of Animals'' 11. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of Apollo, their principal deity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''[[Varia Historia]]'', 2. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], 8.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Vit. Pyth.'' 8.91.141&lt;/ref&gt; Their belief was that the music purifies the soul, just as medicine purifies the body. They also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos, evolving into an idea known as the [[music of the spheres]].&lt;ref&gt;Landels, John G (1999) ''Music in Ancient Greece and Rome''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The music of the spheres.jpg|thumb|The music of the spheres. Shown in this engraving from Renaissance Italy are Apollo, the Muses, the planetary spheres and musical ratios.]]

Apollo appears as the companion of the [[Muses]], and as [[Musagetes]] (&quot;leader of Muses&quot;) he leads them in dance. They spend their time on [[Parnassus]], which is one of their sacred places. Apollo is also the lover of the Muses and by them he became the father of famous musicians like [[Orpheus]] and [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]].

Apollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the [[lyre]].&lt;ref&gt;Iliad (i. 603)&lt;/ref&gt; In his role as the god of banquets, he was always present to play music in weddings of the gods, like the marriage of [[Eros]] and [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]. He is a frequent guest of the [[Bacchanalia]], and many ancient ceramics depict him being at ease amidst the [[maenads]] and satyrs.&lt;ref&gt;Detienne, Marcel (2001) ''Forgetting Delphi between Apollo and Dionysus''&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others. He was the victor in all those contests, but he tended to punish his opponents severely for their [[hubris]].

[[File:Parnassus, Andrea Appiani (1811).jpg|thumb|Apollo and the Muses on Parnassus, by [[Andrea Appiani]]]]

====Apollo's lyre====

The invention of lyre is attributed either to Hermes or to Apollo himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeric Hymn to Hermes (IV, 1-506)|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0138%3ahymn%3d4|website=Perseus|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctions have been made that Hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell, whereas the lyre Apollo invented was a regular lyre.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus&lt;/ref&gt;

Myths tell that the infant Hermes stole a number of Apollo's cows and took them to a cave in the woods near [[Pylos]], covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a [[tortoise]] and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made his [[lyre]].

[[File:Noël Coypel - Story of Apollo-Apollo and Mercury, 1688.jpg|thumb|The friendship of Apollo and Hermes, by [[Noël Coypel]]]]

Upon discovering the theft, Apollo confronted Hermes and asked him to return his cattle. When Hermes acted innocent, Apollo took the matter to Zeus. Zeus, having seen the events, sided with Apollo, and ordered Hermes to return the cattle. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo fell in love with the instrument and offered to exchange the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became the master of the lyre.

[[File:Detail of the statue of Apollo holding the kithara, from the Temple of Venus (Casino Fede) at Hadrian's Villa, Ny Carlsberg Glyptoteket (12233881783).jpg|thumb|Detail of Apollo's lyre]]

According to other versions, Apollo had invented the lyre himself, whose strings he tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to [[Marsyas]]. Hermes' lyre, therefore, would be a reinvention.&lt;ref&gt;Norman O. Brown, ''Hermes the thief''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contest with Pan====
[[File:Laurits Regner Tuxen The-Musical-Dual-Of-Pan-And-Apollo.jpg|thumb|The musical duel of Pan and Apollo, by [[Laurits Tuxen]]]]
Once [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge the god of music to a contest. The mountain-god [[Tmolus]] was chosen to umpire. Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, [[Midas]], who happened to be present. Then, Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. It was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and everyone was pleased with the judgement. Only Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo did not want to suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a [[donkey]].

====Contest with Marsyas====
[[Marsyas]] was a [[satyr]] who was punished by Apollo for his [[hubris]]. He had found an [[aulos]] on the ground, tossed away after being invented by [[Athena]] because it made her cheeks puffy. Athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument, that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished. When Marsyas played the flute, everyone became frenzied with joy. This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo, and he challenged the god to a musical contest. The contest was judged by the [[Muse]]s, or the nymphs of [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]]. Athena was also present to witness the contest.

[[File:Athena Marsyas.jpg|thumb|[[Athena]] and [[Marsyas]]]]

Marsyas taunted Apollo for &quot;wearing his hair long, for having a fair face and smooth body, for his skill in so many arts&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apuleius, Florida 3.2&quot;&gt;Apuleius, ''Florida'' 3.2&lt;/ref&gt; He also further said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;'His [Apollo] hair is smooth and made into tufts and curls that fall about his brow and hang before his face. His body is fair from head to foot, his limbs shine bright, his tongue gives oracles, and he is equally eloquent in prose or verse, propose which you will. What of his robes so fine in texture, so soft to the touch, aglow with purple? What of his lyre that flashes gold, gleams white with ivory, and shimmers with rainbow gems? What of his song, so cunning and so sweet? Nay, all these allurements suit with naught save luxury. To virtue they bring shame alone!'&lt;ref name=&quot;Apuleius, Florida 3.2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Muses and Athena sniggered at this comment. The contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could &quot;do whatever he wanted&quot; to the loser.

[[File:05apol1.jpg|thumb|The contest between Apollo and [[Marsyas]] by [[Palma il Giovane]]]]

According to one account, after the first round, they both were deemed equal by the [[Nysiads]]. But in the next round, Apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance. Marsyas argued against this, saying that Apollo would have an advantage and accused Apollo of cheating. But Apollo replied that since Marsyas played the flute, which needed air blown from the throat, it was similar to singing, and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all. The nymphs decided that Apollo's argument was just. Apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time, mesmerising the audience. Marsyas could not do this. Apollo was declared the winner and, angered with Marsyas' haughtiness and his accusations, decided to flay the satyr.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceD&quot;&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 75. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another account, Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat. Out of shame, he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack.&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus the Younger, Imagines 2 (trans. Fairbanks)&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument. So the Muses who were the judges declared Apollo the winner. Apollo hung Marsyas from a tree to flay him.&lt;ref&gt;''Man Myth and Magic'' by Richard Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marsyas Flayed by the Order of Apollo - Charles André van Loo (1735).jpg|thumb|Marsyas Flayed by the Order of Apollo, by	[[Charles-André van Loo]]]]

Apollo [[flaying|flayed]] the limbs of Marsyas alive in a cave near [[Celaenae]] in [[Phrygia]] for his [[hubris]] to challenge a god. He then gave the rest of his body for proper burial&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 165&lt;/ref&gt; and nailed Marsyas' flayed skin to a nearby pine-tree as a lesson to the others. Marsyas' blood turned into the river Marsyas. But Apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done, he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away. The lyre was later discovered by the Muses and Apollo's sons [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]] and [[Orpheus]]. The Muses fixed the middle string, Linus the string struck with the forefinger, and Orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it. They took it back to Apollo, but the god, who had decided to stay away from music for a while, laid away both the lyre and the pipes at Delphi and joined [[Cybele]] in her wanderings to as far as [[Hyperborea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceD&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apostle Arne Horn, ''The Book of Eusebius'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contest with Cinyras====

Cinyras was a ruler of [[Cyprus]], who was a friend of [[Agamemnon]]. Cinyras promised to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan war, but did not keep his promise. Agamemnon cursed Cinyras. He invoked Apollo and asked the god to avenge the broken promise. Apollo then had a [[lyre]]-playing contest with [[Cinyras]], and defeated him. Either Cinyras committed suicide when he lost, or was killed by Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Iliad, 11. 20-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on Iliad; cf. also scholia on the same passage&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollon Raon Versailles MV5921.jpg|thumb|Apollon Raon, [[Versailles]]]]

===Patron of sailors===
Apollo functions as the patron and protector of sailors, one of the duties he shares with [[Poseidon]]. In the myths, he is seen helping heroes who pray to him for safe journey.

When Apollo spotted a ship of Cretan sailors that was caught in a storm, he quickly assumed the shape of a dolphin and guided their ship safely to Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Hymn to Pythian Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Argonauts]] faced a terrible storm, [[Jason]] prayed to his patron, Apollo, to help them. Apollo used his bow and golden arrow to shed light upon an island, where the Argonauts soon took shelter. This island was renamed &quot;[[Anafi|Anaphe]]&quot;, which means &quot;He revealed it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius of Rhodes, ''Argonautica''&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo helped the Greek hero [[Diomedes]], to escape from a great tempest during his journey homeward. As a token of gratitude, Diomedes built a temple in honor of Apollo under the epithet Epibaterius (&quot;the embarker&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;John Potter, ''Archaeologia Graeca: Or, The Antiquities of Greece, Volume 1''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Trojan War, [[Odysseus]] came to the Trojan camp to return Chriseis, the daughter of Apollo's priest [[Chryses]], and brought many offerings to Apollo. Pleased with this, Apollo sent gentle breezes that helped Odysseus return safely to the Greek camp.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''the Ilaid'' 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arion]] was a poet who was kidnapped by some sailors for the rich prizes he possessed. Arion requested them to let him sing for the last time, to which the sailors consented. Arion began singing a song in praise of Apollo, seeking the god's help. Consequently, numerous dolphins surrounded the ship and when Arion jumped into the water, the dolphins carried him away safely.

===Wars===

====Titanomachy====
Once [[Hera]], out of spite, aroused the Titans to war against [[Zeus]] and take away his throne. Accordingly, when the Titans tried to climb [[Mount Olympus]], Zeus with the help of Apollo, [[Artemis]] and [[Athena]], defeated them and cast them into tartarus.&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 150&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trojan War====
Apollo played a pivotal role in the entire Trojan War. He sided with the Trojans, and sent a terrible plague to the Greek camp, which indirectly led to the conflict between [[Achilles]] and [[Agamemnon]]. He killed the Greek heroes [[Patroclus]], Achilles, and numerous Greek soldiers. He also helped many Trojan heroes, the most important one being [[Hector]]. After the end of the war, Apollo and Poseidon together cleaned the remains of the city and the camps.

[[File:Paris armour Pomarici Santomasi.jpg|thumb|Paris (on the left) putting on his armour as Apollo (on the right) watches him. Attic red-figure kantharos, 425 - 420 BC]]

====Telegony war====
A war broke out between the [[Brygoi]] and the Thesprotians, who had the support of [[Odysseus]]. The gods Athena and [[Ares]] came to the battlefield and took sides. Athena helped the hero Odysseus while Ares fought alongside of the Brygoi. When Odysseus lost, Athena and Ares came into a direct duel. To stop the battling gods and the terror created by their battle, Apollo intervened and stopped the duel between them .&lt;ref&gt;Eugammon of Cyrene, ''Telegony Fragment''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Sammons, ''Device and Composition in the Greek Epic Cycle''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian war====
When Zeus suggested that [[Dionysus]] defeat the Indians in order to earn a place among the gods, Dionysus declared war against the Indians and travelled to India along with his army of [[Bacchantes]] and [[satyrs]]. Among the warriors was [[Aristaeus]], Apollo's son. Apollo armed his son with his own hands and gave him a bow and arrows and fitted a strong shield to his arm.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 13&lt;/ref&gt; After Zeus urged Apollo to join the war, he went to the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 27&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing several of his [[nymphs]] and Aristaeus drowning in a river, he took them to safety and healed them.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 24&lt;/ref&gt; He taught Aristaeus more useful healing arts and sent him back to help the army of Dionysus.

====Theban war====
During the war between the sons of [[Oedipus]], Apollo favored [[Amphiaraus]], a seer and one of the leaders in the war. Though saddened that the seer was fated to be doomed in the war, Apollo made Amphiaraus' last hours glorious by &quot;lighting his shield and his helm with starry gleam&quot;. When [[Hypseus]] tried to kill the hero by a spear, Apollo directed the spear towards the charioteer of Amphiaraus instead. Then Apollo himself replaced the charioteer and took the reins in his hands. He deflected many spears and arrows away them. He also killed many of the enemy warriors like [[Melaneus (mythology)|Melaneus]], [[Antiphus]], Aetion, Polites and [[Lampus]]. At last when the moment of departure came, Apollo expressed his grief with tears in his eyes and bid farewell to Amphiaraus, who was soon engulfed by the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Thebaid'' 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slaying of giants===

Apollo killed the giants Python and Tityos, who had assaulted his mother Leto.

====Gigantomachy====
During the [[gigantomachy]], Apollo killed the giant [[Ephialtes (disambiguation)|Ephialtes]] by shooting him in his eyes. He also killed [[Porphyrion]], the king of giants, using his bow and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, Pythian 8.12–18&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aloadae====
Otis and Ephialtes, the twin giants were together called the [[Aloadae]]. These giants are said to have grown every year by one cubit in breadth and three cubits in height.&lt;ref&gt;{https://www.theoi.com/Gigante/GigantesAloadai.html}&lt;/ref&gt; They once threatened to wage a war on gods and attempted to storm Mt. Olympus by piling up mountains. They also threatened to change land into sea and sea into land. Some say they even dared to seek the hand of Hera and Artemis in marriage. Angered by this, Apollo killed them by shooting arrows at them.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 11. 305&lt;/ref&gt; According to another tale, Apollo killed them with a trick. He sent a deer between them. As they tried to kill it with their javelins, they accidentally stabbed each other and died.&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 28&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phorbas====
[[Phorbas]] was a savage giant king of [[Phlegyas (Boeotia)|Phlegyas]] who was described as having swine like features. He wished to plunder Delphi for its wealth. He seized the roads to Delphi and started harassing the pilgrims. He captured the old people and children and sent them to his army to hold them for ransom. And he challenged the young and sturdy men to a match of boxing, only to cut their heads off when they would get defeated by him. He hung the chopped off heads to an oak tree. Finally, Apollo came to put an end to this cruelty. He entered a boxing contest with Phorbas and killed him with a single blow.&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus the Elder, ''Imagines'' 2. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other stories===

[[File:François Boucher - The Rising of the Sun - WGA02916.jpg|thumb|Apollo as the rising sun, by [[François Boucher]]]]
 
In the first [[Olympic games]], Apollo defeated [[Ares]] and became the victor in wrestling. He outran [[Hermes]] in the race and won first place.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Histories 5. 7. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Apollo divides months into summer and winter.&lt;ref&gt;Orphic hymn to Apollo&lt;/ref&gt; He rides on the back of a swan to the land of the [[Hyperborea]]ns during the winter months, and the absence of warmth in winters is due to his departure. During his absence, Delphi was under the care of [[Dionysus]], and no prophecies were given during winters.

==== Molpadia and Parthenos ====

Molpadia and Parthenos were the sisters of [[Rhoeo]], a former lover of Apollo. One day, they were put in charge of watching their father's ancestral wine jar but they fell asleep while performing this duty. While they were asleep, the wine jar was broken by the swines their family kept. When the sisters woke up and saw what had happened, they threw themselves off a cliff in fear of their father's wrath. Apollo, who was passing by, caught them and carried them to two different cities in Chersonesus, Molpadia to Castabus and Parthenos to Bubastus. He turned them into goddesses and they both received divine honors. Molpadia's name was changed to [[Hemithea (mythology)|Hemithea]] upon her deification.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, 5. 62. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prometheus ====

[[Prometheus]] was the titan who was punished by Zeus for stealing fire. He was bound to a rock, where each day an eagle was sent to eat Prometheus' liver, which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day. Seeing his plight, Apollo pleaded Zeus to release the kind Titan, while Artemis and Leto stood behind him with tears in their eyes. Zeus, moved by Apollo's words and the tears of the goddesses, finally sent Heracles to free Prometheus.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Flaccus, ''Argonautica'' 4. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicolas-Guy Brenet - Apollo Crowning the Arts, 1771.jpg|thumb|Apollo crowning the arts, by [[Nicolas-Guy Brenet]]]]

==== The rock of Leukas ====

Leukatas was believed to be a white colored rock jutting out from the island of [[Lefkada|Leukas]] into the sea. It was present in the sanctuary of Apollo Leukates. A leap from this rock was believed to have put an end to the longings of love.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strabo, Geography 10. 2. 8&quot;&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'' 10. 2. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Once, Aphrodite fell deeply in love with [[Adonis]], a young man of great beauty who was later accidentally killed by a boar. Heartbroken, Aphrodite wandered looking for the rock of Leukas. When she reached the sanctuary of Apollo in Argos, she confided in him her love and sorrow. Apollo then brought her to the rock of Leukas and asked her to throw herself from the top of the rock. She did so and was freed from her love. When she sought for the reason behind this, Apollo told her that Zeus, before taking another lover, would sit on this rock to free himself from his love to Hera.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceE&quot;&gt;Ptolemy Hephaestion, ''New History Book'' 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tale relates that a man named Nireus, who fell in love with the cult statue of Athena, came to the rock and jumped in order relieve himself. After jumping, he fell into the net of a fisherman in which, when he was pulled out, he found a box filled with gold. He fought with the fisherman and took the gold, but Apollo appeared to him in the night in a dream and warned him not to appropriate gold which belonged to others.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceE&quot;/&gt;

It was an ancestral custom among the Leukadians to fling a criminal from this rock every year at the sacrifice performed in honor of Apollo for the sake of averting evil. However, a number of men would be stationed all around below rock to catch the criminal and take him out of the borders in order to exile him from the island.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''On Animals'' 11. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceE&quot;/&gt; This was the same rock from which, according to a legend, Sappho took her suicidal leap.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strabo, Geography 10. 2. 8&quot;/&gt;

===Female lovers===

Love affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The love-stories themselves were not told until later.&quot; [[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Gods of the Greeks'' 1951:140.&lt;/ref&gt; Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance, the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.

{{Main|Apollo and Daphne}}

[[File:Apollo and Daphne (Bernini).jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Apollo and Daphne]]'' by [[Bernini]] in the [[Galleria Borghese]]]]
[[Daphne]] was a [[nymph]] whose parentage varies. She scorned Apollo's advances and ran away from him. When Apollo chased her in order to persuade her, she changed herself into a laurel tree. According to other versions, she cried for help during the chase, and [[Gaea]] helped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheDaphne.html | title=DAPHNE - Laurel Nymph of Greek Mythology}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roman poet [[Ovid]], the chase was brought about by [[Cupid]], who hit Apollo with golden arrow of love and Daphne with leaden arrow of hatred. The myth explains the origin of the [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] and connection of Apollo with the laurel and its leaves, which his priestess employed at [[Delphi]]. The leaves became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths were given to the victors of the [[Pythian games]].

[[File:Robert Sanderson - Apollo and the Muses.jpg|thumb|Apollo and the Muses, by Robert Sanderson]]
Apollo is said to have been the lover of all nine [[Muses]], and not being able to choose one of them, decided to remain unwed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ApollonLoves.html | title=APOLLO MYTHS 2 LOVES - Greek Mythology}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fathered the [[Corybantes]] by the Muse [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]],&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html ''Bibliotheca'', 1.3.4].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orpheus]] by [[Calliope]], [[Linus (Thracian)|Linus of Thrace]] by Calliope or [[Urania]] and [[Hymenaios]](Hymen) by either [[Terpsichore]] or [[Clio]] or Calliope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/ErosHymenaios.html | title=HYMENAEUS (Hymenaios) - Greek God of Weddings &amp; the Bridal Hymn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cyrene and Cattle - Edward Calvert.jpg|thumb|Cyrene and Cattle, by [[Edward Calvert (painter)|Edward Calvert]]]]
[[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]], was a Thessalian princess whom Apollo loved. In her honor, he built the city Cyrene and made her its ruler. She was later granted longevity by Apollo who turned her into a nymph. The couple had two sons, [[Aristaeus]], and [[Idmon]].

[[Evadne]] was a nymph daughter of Poseidon and a lover of Apollo. She bore him a son, [[Iamos]]. During the time of the childbirth, Apollo sent [[Eileithyia]], the goddess of childbirth to assist her.

[[Rhoeo]], a princess of the island of Naxos was loved by Apollo. Out of affection for her, Apollo turned her sisters into goddesses. On the island Delos she bore Apollo a son named [[Anius]]. Not wanting to have the child, she entrusted the infant to Apollo and left. Apollo raised and educated the child on his own.

Ourea, a daughter of [[Poseidon]], fell in love with Apollo when he and Poseidon were serving the Trojan king [[Laomedon]]. They both united on the day the walls of [[Troy]] were built. She bore to Apollo a son, whom Apollo named Ileus, after the city of his birth, Ilion ([[Troy]]). Ileus was very dear to Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Catalogues of Women Fragment'' 83&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thero (mythology)|Thero]], daughter of [[Phylas]], a maiden as beautiful as the moonbeams, was loved by the radiant Apollo, and she loved him in return. By their union, she became mother of Chaeron, who was famed as &quot;the tamer of horses&quot;. He later built the city [[Chaeronea]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyrie or Thyrie was the mother of [[Cycnus (son of Apollo)|Cycnus]]. Apollo turned both the mother and son into swans when they jumped into a lake and tried to kill themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Heros/KyknosThyrios.html | title=CYCNUS (Kyknos) - Aetolian Prince of Greek Mythology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hecuba]] was the wife of King [[Priam]] of [[Troy]], and Apollo had a son with her named [[Troilus]]. An [[oracle]] prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive. He was ambushed and killed by [[Achilleus]], and Apollo avenged his death by killing Achilles. After the sack of Troy, Hecuba was taken to Lycia by Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stesichorus]], Fr.108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coronis (Greek mythology)|Coronis]], was daughter of [[Phlegyas]], King of the [[Lapiths]]. While pregnant with [[Asclepius]], Coronis fell in love with [[Ischys]], son of [[Elatus]] and slept with him. When Apollo found out about her infidelity through his prophetic powers, he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis. Apollo rescued the baby by cutting open Koronis' belly and gave it to the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] to raise.

In [[Euripides]]' play ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'', Apollo fathered [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] by [[Creusa (daughter of Erechtheus)|Creusa]], wife of [[Xuthus]]. He used his powers to conceal her pregnancy from her father. Later, when Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, Apollo asked [[Hermes]] to save the child and bring him to the oracle at [[Delphi]], where he was raised by a priestess.

===Male lovers===

[[File:Cesio, Carlo 1626 - 1686) - Apollo e Giacinto, inc. da Annibale Carracci, -1675-.jpg|thumb|''Apollo and Hyacinthus'', by Carlo Cesio]]
[[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]] or Hyacinthus was one of Apollo's favorite lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 10&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Sparta]]n prince, beautiful and athletic. The pair was practicing throwing the [[Discus throw|discus]] when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous [[Zephyrus]] and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly. Apollo is said to be filled with grief. Out of Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created a [[hyacinth (plant)|flower]] named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection {{lang|grc|αἰαῖ}}, meaning ''alas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ai)ai{{=}}|αἰαῖ}}, {{LSJ|ai)/2|αἴ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was later resurrected and taken to heaven. The festival [[Hyacinthia]] was a national celebration of Sparta, which commemorated the death and rebirth of Hyacinthus.
[[File:Kiselev Death of Hyacinth.jpg|thumb|Death of Hyacinth, by [[Alexander Kiselyov (painter)|Alexander Kiselyov]]]]

Another male lover was [[Cyparissus]], a descendant of [[Heracles]]. Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a [[Pilum|javelin]] as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus was so saddened by its death that he asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo granted the request by turning him into the [[Cupressaceae|Cypress]] named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.

[[File:Granger-Apollo.jpg|thumb|Apollo and Cyparissus, by Jean-Pierre Granger (1779–1840)]]

[[Admetus]], the king of Pherae, was also Apollo's lover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Callimachus]], Hymn to Apollo, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Numa&quot;&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Numa'', 4. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; During his exile, which lasted either for one year or nine years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keaveney|first=Arthur|date=1984-01-01|journal=Philologus|volume=128|issue=1–2|doi=10.1524/phil.1984.128.12.138|issn=2196-7008|title=A Note on Servius, Ad ''Aeneid'' 7, 637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo served Admetus as a herdsman. The romantic nature of their relationship was first described by [[Callimachus]] of Alexandria, who wrote that Apollo was &quot;fired with love&quot; for Admetus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callimachus, Hymn to Apollo&quot;/&gt; Plutarch lists Admetus as one of Apollo's lovers and says that Apollo served Admetus because he doted upon him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], '''Amatorius'' 17&lt;/ref&gt; Latin poet [[Ovid]] in his [[Ars Amatoria]] said that even though he was a god, Apollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of Admetus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' 2.239&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tibullus]] desrcibes Apollo's love to the king as ''servitium amoris'' (slavery of love) and asserts that Apollo became his servant not by force but by choice. He would also make cheese and serve it to Admetus. His domestic actions caused embarrassment to his family.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tibullus]], ''Elegies'' 2.3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicolas-Antoine Taunay - Apolo visitando Admeto.jpg|thumb|Apollo visiting Admetus, by [[Nicolas-Antoine Taunay]]]]
{{quote| Oh how often his sister (Diana) blushed at meeting her brother as he carried a young calf through the fields!....often Latona lamented when she saw her son's disheveled locks which were admired even by Juno, his step-mother...&lt;ref&gt;Tibullus, ''Elegies'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When Admetus wanted to marry princess [[Alcestis]], Apollo provided a chariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed. This satisfied Alcestis' father and he let Admetus marry his daughter. Further, Apollo saved the king from Artemis' wrath and also convinced the [[Moirai]] to postpone Admetus' death once.

[[Branchus]], a shepherd, one day came across Apollo in the woods. Captivated by the god's beauty, he kissed Apollo. Apollo requited his affections and wanting to reward him, bestowed prophetic skills on him. His descendants, the Branchides, were an influential clan of prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Pepin, Ronald E. (2008). The Vatican Mythographers. Fordham Univ Press. {{ISBN|9780823228928}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Phorbas]], the dragon slayer (probably the son of Triopas)&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Numa'', 4. 5, cf. also [[Hyginus]], ''Poetical Astronomy'', 2. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===

Apollo sired many children, from mortal women and nymphs as well as the goddesses. His children grew up to be physicians, musicians, poets, seers or archers. Many of his sons founded new cities and became kings. They were all usually very beautiful.

[[File:1590. Apollo Entrusting Chiron with the Education of Aescalapius - etching - Washington DC, NGA.jpg|thumb|Apollo Entrusting [[Chiron]] with the Education of Aescalapius]]

[[Asclepius]] is the most famous son of Apollo. His skills as a physician surpassed that of Apollo's. Zeus killed him for bringing back the dead, but upon Apollo's request, he was resurrected as a god. 
[[Aristaeus]] was placed under the care of Chiron after his birth. He became the god of beekeeping, cheese making, animal husbandry and more. He was ultimately given immortality for the benefits he bestowed upon the humanity. The [[Corybantes]] were spear-clashing, dancing demigods.

The sons of Apollo who participated in the Trojan War include the Trojan princes [[Hector]] and [[Troilus]], as well as [[Tenes]], the king of [[Tenedos]], all three of whom were killed by Achilles over the course of the war.

Apollo's children who became musicians and bards include [[Orpheus]], [[Linus (mythology)|Linus]], [[Ialemus]], [[Hymen (god)|Hymen]]aeus, [[Philammon]], [[Eumolpus]] and [[Eleuther]]. Apollo fathered 3 daughters, [[Apollonis]], [[Borysthenis]] and [[Cephisso]], who formed a group of minor Muses, the &quot;Musa Apollonides&quot;. They were nicknamed Nete, Mese and Hypate after the highest, middle and lowest strings of his lyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/MousaiApollonides.html | title=MUSES APOLLONIDES (Mousai) - Greek Goddesses of Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phemonoe]] was a seer and a poetess who was the inventor of Hexameter.

[[Apis (Greek mythology)|Apis]], [[Idmon]], [[Iamus]], [[Tenerus (son of Apollo)|Tenerus]], [[Mopsus]], [[Themisto (disambiguation)|Galeus]], Telmessus and others were gifted seers. [[Anius]], Pythaeus and [[Ismenus]] lived as high priests. Most of them were trained by Apollo himself.

[[Arabius (mythology)|Arabus]], [[Delphos (mythology)|Delphos]], [[Dryops (mythology)|Dryops]], [[Miletos]], [[Tenes]], [[Epidaurus (mythology)|Epidaurus]], Ceos, [[Lycorus|Lycoras]], [[Syrus]], Pisus, Marathus, Megarus, Patarus, [[Acraepheus]], Cicon, Chaeron and many other sons of Apollo, under the guidance of his words, founded eponymous cities.

He also had a son named Chrysorrhoas who was a mechanic artist.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Of the Names of Rivers and Mountains, and Of Such Things as are to be Found Therein''&lt;/ref&gt; His other daughters include [[Eurynome]], [[Chariclo]] wife of [[Chiron]], [[Eurydice]] the wife of Orpheus, [[Eriopis]], famous for her beautiful hair, [[Melite (heroine)|Melite]] the heroine, [[Pamphile]] the silk weaver, Parthenos, and by some accounts, Phoebe, Hilyra and [[Scylla]]. Apollo turned Parthenos into a constellation after her early death.

Additionally, Apollo fostered and educated [[Chiron]], the centaur who later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods, including Apollo's sons. Apollo also fostered [[Carnus]], the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]].

===Failed love attempts===

[[Marpessa]] was kidnapped by [[Idas]] but was loved by Apollo as well. [[Zeus]] made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.

[[Sinope (mythology)|Sinope]], a nymph, was approached by the amorous Apollo. She made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for, and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin. Apollo kept his promise and went back.

[[Bolina]] was admired by Apollo but she refused him and jumped into the sea. To avoid her death, Apollo turned her into a nymph and let her go.

[[Castalia]] was a [[nymph]] whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dove into the [[castalian Spring|spring]] at Delphi, at the base of [[Mt. Parnassos]], which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses.

[[Cassandra]], was a daughter of Hecuba and Priam. Apollo wished to court her. Cassandra promised to return his love on one condition - he should give her the power to see the future. Apollo fulfilled her wish, but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after. Angered that she broke her promise, Apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future, no one would ever believe her prophecies.

[[Hestia]], the goddess of the hearth, rejected both Apollo's and Poseidon's marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried.

===Female counterparts===

====Artemis====

[[File:Apollo Artemis Brygos Louvre G151.jpg|thumb|250px|Apollo (left) and [[Artemis]]. [[Brygos]] (potter signed), tondo of an Attic red-figure cup c. 470 BC, [[Musée du Louvre]].]]

Artemis as the sister of Apollo, is ''thea apollousa'', that is, she as a female divinity represented the same idea that Apollo did as a male divinity. In the pre-Hellenic period, their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife, and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo. However, this relationship was never sexual but spiritual,&lt;ref&gt;Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1197&lt;/ref&gt; which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the [[Hellenic period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;theoi.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Artemis.html | title=ARTEMIS - Greek Goddess of Hunting &amp; Wild Animals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gavin Hamilton - Apollo and Artemis, 1770.jpg|thumb|Apollo and Artemis, by Gavin Hamilton]]

Artemis, like her brother, is armed with a bow and arrows. She is the cause of sudden deaths of women. She also is the protector of the young, especially girls. Though she has nothing to do with oracles, music or poetry, she sometimes led the female chorus on Olympus while Apollo sang.&lt;ref name=&quot;theoi.com&quot;/&gt; The laurel (''[[daphne]]'') was sacred to both. ''Artemis Daphnaia'' had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi.&lt;ref&gt;G. Shipley, &quot;The Extent of Spartan Territory in the Late Classical and Hellenistic Periods&quot;, ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Apollo Daphnephoros'' had a temple in [[Eretria]], a &quot;place where the citizens are to take the oaths&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rufus B. Richardson, &quot;A Temple in Eretria&quot; ''The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts'', '''10'''.3 (July - September 1895:326–337); Paul Auberson, ''Eretria. Fouilles et Recherches I, Temple d'Apollon Daphnéphoros, Architecture'' (Bern, 1968). See also [[Plutarch]], ''Pythian Oracle'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In later times when Apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or [[Helios]], Artemis was naturally regarded as [[Selene]] or the moon.

====Hecate====

[[Hecate]], the goddess of witchcraft and magic, is the chthonic counterpart of Apollo. They both are cousins, since their mothers - [[Leto]] and [[Asteria (Titaness)|Asteria]] - are sisters. One of Apollo's epithets, ''Hecatos'', is the masculine form of Hecate, and both the names mean &quot;working from afar&quot;. While Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven, Hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanKoios.html | title=COEUS (Koios) - Greek Titan God of Intellect &amp; the Axis of Heaven}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Hecate is the &quot;gate-keeper&quot;, Apollo ''Agyieus'' is the &quot;door-keeper&quot;. Hecate is the goddess of crossroads and Apollo is the god and protector of streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Carol M. Mooney, B.A., ''Hekate : 
Her Role And Character 
In Greek Literature 
From Before The Fifth Century B.C.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jusepe de Ribera - Hecate, Procession to a Witches' Sabbath.jpg|thumb|Hecate's procession by the witches, by [[Jusepe de Ribera]]]]

[[File:Guido Reni 008.jpg|thumb|Apollo accompanied by the [[Horae]] (hours) and [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], by [[Guido Reni]]]]

The oldest evidence found for Hecate's worship is at Apollo's temple in Miletos. There, Hecate was taken to be Apollo's sister counterpart in the absence of Artemis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Hecate's lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements, at the same time, Apollo's solar nature.

====Athena====

As a deity of knowledge and great power, Apollo was seen being the male counterpart of [[Athena]]. Being Zeus' favorite children, they were given more powers and duties. Apollo and Athena often took up the role as protectors of cities, and were patrons of some of the important cities. Athena was the principle goddess of [[Athens]], Apollo was the principle god of [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://publicism.info/culture/apollo/7.html | title=APOLLO, THE YOUNG, AND THE CITY - KEY THEMES - Apollo - Fritz Graf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Houbraken, Arnold - Pallas Athene Visiting Apollo on the Parnassus - 1703.jpeg|thumb|Pallas Athene Visiting Apollo on the Parnassus, by [[Arnold Houbraken]]]]

As patrons of arts, Apollo and Athena were companions of the [[Muses]], the former a much more frequent companion than the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dawkins, ''The Shakespeare Enigma''&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo was sometimes called the son of Athena and Hephaestus due to his wise and artistic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Athena.html | title=ATHENA - Greek Goddess of Wisdom, War &amp; Crafts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Trojan war, as Zeus' executive, Apollo is seen holding the [[aegis]] like Athena usually does.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, Iliad 15.308&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's decisions were usually approved by his sister Athena, and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;1.Homer, ''Iliad'', Euripides, ''Ion'', Aeschylus, ''Oresteia''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apollo in the ''Oresteia''===
In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'' trilogy, [[Clytemnestra]] kills her husband, King [[Agamemnon]] because he had sacrificed their daughter [[Iphigenia]] to proceed forward with the Trojan war. Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon's son, [[Orestes]], is to kill Clytemnestra and [[Aegisthus]], her lover. Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the [[Erinyes]] or Furies (female personifications of [[revenge|vengeance]]).

Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the [[matricide]] was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. They invade his temple, and he drives them away. He says that the matter should be brought before Athena. Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo's [[Supplication|supplicant]]. Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo.

===Roman Apollo===

The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}} As a quintessentially [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek god]], Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as '''Phoebus'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Koronis.html |title=Koronis |publisher=Theoi |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the [[Roman Kingdom|kings of Rome]] during the reign of [[Tarquinius Superbus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Liv.+1.56 1.56].&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo's [[Temple of Apollo Sosianus|first temple]] at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the &quot;Apollinare&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Livy [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=3:chapter=63 3.63.7], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0145:book=4:chapter=25 4.25.3].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second Punic War]] in 212 BCE, the ''[[Ludi Apollinares]]'' (&quot;Apollonian Games&quot;) were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius.&lt;ref&gt;Livy [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0147:book=25:chapter=12 25.12].&lt;/ref&gt; In the time of [[Augustus]], who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J. H. W. G. Liebeschuetz |title=Continuity and Change in Roman Religion |year=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-814822-7 |pages=82–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}}

After the [[battle of Actium]], which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollo's temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted [[quinquennial]] games in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars#Life of Augustus|Augustus]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#18.2 18.2]; [[Cassius Dio]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#1 51.1.1–3].&lt;/ref&gt; He also erected [[Temple of Apollo (Palatine)|a new temple]] to the god on the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine hill]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#1.3 53.1.3].&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] formed the culmination of the [[Secular Games]], held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 5050, translated by {{cite book |last1=Beard |first1=Mary |authorlink=Mary Beard (classicist) |last2=North |first2=John |last3=Price |first3=Simon |title=Religions of Rome: Volume 2: A Sourcebook |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-45015-7|page=5.7b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
The chief Apollonian festival was the [[Pythian Games]] held every four years at Delphi and was one of the four great [[Panhellenic Games]]. Also of major importance was the [[Delia (festival)|Delia]] held every four years on Delos.
Athenian annual festivals included the [[Boedromia]], [[Metageitnia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=William |title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (1890),MACELLUM, MATRA'LIA, METAGEI'TNIA |date=1890 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DM%3Aentry+group%3D2%3Aentry%3Dmetageitnia-cn |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pyanepsia]], and [[Thargelia]].
Spartan annual festivals were the [[Carneia]] and the [[Hyacinthia]].
[[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] every nine years held the [[Daphnephoria]].

==Attributes and symbols==

Apollo's most common attributes were the bow and [[arrow]]. Other attributes of his included the [[kithara]] (an advanced version of the common [[lyre]]), the [[plectrum]] and the sword. Another common emblem was the [[sacrificial tripod]], representing his prophetic powers. The [[Pythian Games]] were held in Apollo's honor every four years at [[Delphi]]. The [[bay laurel]] plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the [[laurel wreath|crown of victory]] at these games.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}}

[[File:Ai-Khanoum-gold stater of Antiochos1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gold stater of the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus I Soter]] (reigned 281–261 BCE) showing on the reverse a nude Apollo holding his key attributes: two arrows and a bow]]

The [[palm tree]] was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in [[Delos]]. Animals sacred to Apollo included [[wolf|wolves]], dolphins, [[roe deer]], [[swan]]s, [[cicada]]s (symbolizing music and song), [[raven]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[Corvus (genus)|crow]]s (Apollo had hawks and crows as his messengers),&lt;ref name=&quot;Porphyry&quot;/&gt; snakes (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), mice and [[griffin]]s, mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}}

[[Homer]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], wrote that Apollo had a hawk as his messenger.&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/3#15.493 Homer, Odyssey, 15.493]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Porphyry&quot;&gt;[http://cts.perseids.org/read/greekLit/tlg2034/tlg003/1st1K-grc1/3.5 Porphyry, De abstinentia, 3.5]&lt;/ref&gt; In many myths Apollo is transformed into a hawk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/216#28 Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses, 28]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/141#6.103 Ovid, Metamorphoses, 6.103]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/141#11.318 Ovid, Metamorphoses, 11.318]&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, [[Claudius Aelianus]] wrote that in [[Egyptians|Ancient Egypt]] people believed that hawks were sacred to the god&lt;ref name=&quot;Aelian 10.14&quot;/&gt; and that according to the ministers of Apollo in Egypt there were certain men called &quot;hawk-keepers&quot; (ἱερακοβοσκοί) who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0545.tlg001.perseus-grc1:7.9 Aelian, Characteristics of Animals, 7.9]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]] wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of Apollo in Egypt and that the city's symbol is a man with a hawklike face ([[Horus]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/230#3.12.1 Eusebius, Preparation of the Gospels, 3.12.1]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudius Aelianus]] wrote that Egyptians called Apollo [[Horus]] in their own language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aelian 10.14&quot;&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/560#10.14 Aelian, Characteristics of Animals, 10.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apolocitaredo8.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Apollo Citharoedus]]'' (&quot;Apollo with a kithara&quot;), [[Musei Capitolini]], Rome]]
As god of colonization, Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750–550 BCE. According to Greek tradition, he helped [[Crete|Cretan]] or [[Arcadia]]n colonists found the city of [[Troy]]. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts mention a Minor Asian god called ''Appaliunas'' or ''Apalunas'' in connection with the city of [[Wilusa]] attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek [[Troy|Ilion]] by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo's title of ''Lykegenes'' can simply be read as &quot;born in Lycia&quot;, which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a [[folk etymology]]).

In literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of [[Dionysus]], god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives [[Apollonian and Dionysian]]. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for [[Hyperborea]], he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the [[Borghese Vase]].

Apollo is often associated with the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|Golden Mean]]. This is the Greek [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of [[moderation]] and a [[virtue]] that opposes [[gluttony]].

==Apollo in the arts==
[[File:Apollo Saurocton Louvre.jpg|thumb|180px|The Louvre ''Apollo Sauroctonos'', Roman copy after [[Praxiteles]] (360 BC)]]
Apollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the [[Renaissance]]. The earliest Greek word for a statue is &quot;delight&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἄγαλμα}}, ''agalma''), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision. Greek art puts into Apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined. The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.

The naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity. The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment. The statues of Apollo embody beauty, balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world.

The evolution of the Greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal [[Kouros]] type in [[Archaic period in Greece|early archaic period]], to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in [[Archaic period in Greece|late archaic period]]. In [[classical Greece]] the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms, but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole, a method created by [[Polykleitos]]. Finally [[Praxiteles]] seems to be released from any art and religious conformities, and his masterpieces are a mixture of [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]] with stylization.

===Art and Greek philosophy===
The evolution of the Greek art seems to go parallel with the Greek philosophical conceptions, which changed from the natural-philosophy of [[Thales]] to the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory of [[Pythagoras]]. Thales searched for a simple material-form directly perceptible by the senses, behind the appearances of things, and his theory is also related to the older [[animism]]. This was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life, through unnaturally simplified forms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Homann63&quot;&gt;E. Homann-Wedeking. Transl. J.R. Foster (1968). ''Art of the world. Archaic Greece'', Methuen &amp; Co Ltd. London, pp. 63–65, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics, and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation.&lt;ref name=&quot;C. M. Bowra 1957 p. 166&quot;/&gt; The forms on Earth, are imperfect imitations ({{lang|grc|εἰκόνες}}, ''eikones'', &quot;images&quot;) of the celestial world of numbers. His ideas had a great influence on post-Archaic art. The Greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation, that would lead to the esthetic perfection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter55&quot;&gt;R. Carpenter (1975). ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. pp. 55–58.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Aesthetic canon|canon]]).

In classical Greece, [[Anaxagoras]] asserted that a divine reason (mind) gave order to the seeds of the universe, and [[Plato]] extended the Greek belief of ''ideal forms'' to his metaphysical theory of ''forms'' (''ideai'', &quot;ideas&quot;). The forms on Earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas. The Greek words ''oida'' ({{lang|grc|οἶδα}}, &quot;(I) know&quot;) and ''eidos'' ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}}, &quot;species&quot;), a thing seen, have the same root as the word ''idea'' ({{lang|grc|ἰδέα}}), a thing ἰδείν to see.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The same root of looking or seeing&quot; . R. Carpenter (1975). ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. p.107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|idea}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating how the Greek mind moved from the gift of the senses, to the principles beyond the senses. The artists in Plato's time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization. The Greek sculptors considered the senses more important, and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual.

===Archaic sculpture===
[[File:KAMA Kouros Porte Sacrée.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Sacred Gate Kouros, marble (610–600 BC), [[Kerameikos|Kerameikos Archaeological Museum in Athens]]]]

[[Kouros]] (''male youth'') is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the [[archaic period in Greece]]. This type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of ''Apollo''.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Leonardos(1895). ''Archaelogiki Ephimeris'', Col 75, n 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lechat (1904). ''La sculpture Attic avant Phidias'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The first statues are certainly still and formal. The formality of their stance seems to be related with the [[Egypt]]ian precedent, but it was accepted for a good reason. The sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is, and embodied the archaic smile of good manners, the firm and springy step, the balance of the body, dignity, and youthful happiness. When they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men, it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowra144&quot;&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957). ''The Greek experience'', pp. 144–152.&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time, is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions, and also due to the general Greek belief that nature expresses itself in ''ideal forms'' that can be imagined and represented.&lt;ref name=Carpenter55/&gt; These forms expressed immortality. Apollo was the immortal god of ''ideal balance and order''. His shrine in [[Delphi]], that he shared in winter with Dionysius had the inscriptions: {{lang|grc|γνῶθι σεαυτόν}} (gnōthi seautón=&quot;know thyself&quot;) and {{lang|grc|μηδὲν ἄγαν}} (''mēdén ágan'', &quot;nothing in excess&quot;), and {{lang|grc|ἐγγύα πάρα δ'ἄτη}} (eggýa pára d'atē, &quot;make a pledge and mischief is nigh&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;See {{LSJ|a)/th|ἄτη|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first large-scale depictions during the early archaic period (640–580 BC), the artists tried to draw one's attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses, but as being full of life. The Greeks maintained, until late in their civilization, an almost [[animism|animistic]] idea that the statues are in some sense alive. This embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself.&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Bowra. ''The Greek experience'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; A fine example is the statue of the ''[[Sacred Gate]] Kouros'' which was found at the cemetery of [[Dipylon]] in Athens ([[Dipylon Kouros]]). The statue is the &quot;thing in itself&quot;, and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity. According to the Greek tradition the [[Dipylon|Dipylon master]] was named [[Daedalus]], and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body, giving the impression that the statues could move. It is considered that he created also the ''New York kouros'', which is the oldest fully preserved statue of ''Kouros'' type, and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself.&lt;ref name=Homann63/&gt;

[[File:7262 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - The Piraeus Apollo - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Piraeus Apollo]], archaic-style bronze, [[Archaeological Museum of Piraeus]]]]
The animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality, is sanctified in the [[Homeric]] poems and in Greek myths, in stories of the god [[Hephaestus]] ([[Phaistos]]) and the mythic [[Daedalus]] (the builder of the [[labyrinth]]) that made images which moved of their own accord. This kind of art goes back to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] period, when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schachermeyer242&quot;&gt;F. Schachermeyer (1964). ''Die Minoische Kultur des alten Creta'', Stuttgart: [[Kohlhammer Verlag]], pp. 242–244.&lt;/ref&gt; These free-standing statues were usually marble, but also the form rendered in limestone, bronze, ivory and terracotta.

The earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo, may be two figures from the [[Ionians|Ionic]] sanctuary on the island of [[Delos]]. Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of ''Apollo Ptoios'', [[Boeotia]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ducat (1971). ''Les Kouroi des Ptoion''.&lt;/ref&gt; The last stage in the development of the ''Kouros type'' is the late archaic period (520–485 BC), in which the Greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole. Ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze [[Piraeus Apollo]]. It was found in [[Piraeus]], the harbour of Athens. The statue originally held the bow in its left hand, and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand. It probably comes from north-eastern [[Peloponnesus]]. The emphasis is given in anatomy, and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion, and beauty relative to proportions, which appear mostly in post-Archaic art. The statue throws some light on an artistic centre which, with an independently developed harder, simpler and heavier style, restricts [[Ionia]]n influence in Athens. Finally, this is the germ from which the art of [[Polykleitos]] was to grow two or three generations later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Homann144&quot;&gt;Homann-Wedeking (1966). ''Art of the World. Archaic Greece'', pp. 144–150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical sculpture===

[[File:Apollon de Mantoue Louvre MA689.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Apollo of the &quot;Mantoua type&quot;, marble Roman copy after a 5th-century BCE Greek original attributed to [[Polykleitos]], Musée du Louvre]]

At the beginning of the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else, consisted of symmetry and proportions. The artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment ([[Myron]]), which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] element.&lt;ref name=Schachermeyer242/&gt; Anatomy and geometry are fused in one, and each does something to the other. The Greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions, just as they sought some reality behind appearances. [[Polykleitos]] in his ''Canon'' wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements (materials), but of the parts, that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole. It seems that he was influenced by the theories of [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Each part (finger, palm, arm, etc.) transmitted its individual existence to the next, and then to the whole&quot; : ''Canon of [[Polykleitos]]'', also [[Plotinus]], ''Ennead'' I vi. i: Nigel Spivey (1997). ''Greek art'', Phaidon Press Ltd. London. pp. 290–294.&lt;/ref&gt;
The famous ''Apollo of Mantua'' and its variants are early forms of the [[Apollo Citharoedus]] statue type, in which the god holds the [[cithara]] in his left arm. The type is represented by [[neo-Attic]] Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of [[Polykleitos]] but more archaic. The Apollo held the ''cythara'' against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example, a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps.

Though the proportions were always important in Greek art, the appeal of the Greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone. The statues of Apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence, and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] period, and in the beliefs of the first [[Greek language|Greek]] speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age. Just as the Greeks saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings, so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form, and the form of a work of art. Spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form. Just as in the arts the Greeks sought some reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same. Artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect, as to the whole sentient self.&lt;ref name=Homann63/&gt; Things as we see them, and as they really are, are one, that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity.

===Pediments and friezes===

[[File:Apollo west pediment Olympia copy MFA Munich.jpg|thumb|upright|Apollo, West Pediment Olympia. Munich, copy from original, 460 BCE at the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]], [[Olympia, Greece]].]]

In the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples, the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base.

The [[Siphnian Treasury]] in [[Delphi]] was one of the first Greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle, and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling. The pediment shows the story of [[Heracles]] stealing Apollo's tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration. Their two figures hold the centre. In the pediment of the temple of [[Zeus]] in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], the single figure of Apollo is dominating the scene.&lt;ref name=Bowra144/&gt;

[[File:Belvedere Apollo Pio-Clementino Inv1015 n3.jpg|175px|thumb|Head of the ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]'']]

These representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake. They care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space, but only as parts in a larger whole. While each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs. In these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals, to suggest a passage to and from a busy battlefield. The artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order, and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy.&lt;ref name=Bowra144/&gt;

===Hellenistic Greece-Rome===
Apollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a [[kithara]] (as [[Apollo Citharoedus]]) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the [[Apollo Lykeios]] and [[Apollo Sauroctonos]] types). The [[Apollo Belvedere]] is a [[marble]] sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of [[Classical Antiquity]] for Europeans, from the [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century. The marble is a [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor [[Leochares]], made between 350 and 325 BCE.

The life-size so-called &quot;[[Adonis]]&quot; found in 1780 on the site of a ''[[Roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' near the [[Via Labicana]] in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars. In the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from [[El Djem]], Roman ''Thysdrus'', he is identifiable as [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] by his effulgent [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], though now even a god's divine [[nudity|nakedness]] is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later [[Roman Empire|Empire]].

Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from [[Hadrumentum]], is in the museum at [[Sousse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |title=Mosaics in Tunisia: Apollo and the Muses |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=30 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708143541/http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |archivedate=8 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling [[Hairstyle|hair cut]] in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Bieber 1964, Yalouris 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.

==Modern reception==
Apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature. [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] composed a &quot;Hymn of Apollo&quot; (1820), and the god's instruction of the Muses formed the subject of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Apollon musagète]]'' (1927–1928). In 1978, the Canadian band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] released [[Hemispheres (Rush album)|an album]] with songs [[Cygnus X-1 Book II|&quot;Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom&quot;/&quot;Dionysus: Bringer of Love&quot;]].

In discussion of the arts, a distinction is sometimes made between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable. [[Carl Jung]]'s [[Apollo archetype]] represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional distance.

[[Charles Handy]], in ''Gods of Management'' (1978) uses Greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of [[organizational culture|organisational culture]]. Apollo represents a 'role' culture where order, reason, and [[bureaucracy]] prevail.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Library]]: Management and Business Studies Portal, [https://mbsportal.bl.uk/taster/subjareas/busmanhist/mgmtthinkers/handy.aspx Charles Handy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112144123/https://mbsportal.bl.uk/taster/subjareas/busmanhist/mgmtthinkers/handy.aspx |date=12 November 2016 }}, accessed 12 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In spaceflight, the 1960s and 1970s [[NASA]] program for orbiting and landing astronauts on the Moon was named [[Apollo program|Apollo]].

==International tennis career biography==

===1986–1993: Breakthrough and the first major title===
[[File:Agassi in argentina.jpg|thumb|Agassi when he played the Davis Cup Americas zone in Buenos Aires, 1988]]
Agassi turned professional at the age of 16 and competed in his first tournament at [[La Quinta, California]]. He won his first match against [[John Austin (tennis)|John Austin]], but then lost his second match to [[Mats Wilander]]. By the end of 1986, Agassi was ranked No. 91.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tennis28&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennis28.com/rankings/history/agassi.html |title=Tennis28-Bio:Andre Agassi |accessdate=June 12, 2009 |publisher=Tennis28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at the [[ATP Itaparica|Sul American Open]] in [[Itaparica]]&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; and ended the year ranked No. 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He won six additional tournaments in 1988 (Memphis, [[1988 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships|U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships]], [[World Championship Tennis#WCT 1988|Forest Hills WCT]], Stuttgart Outdoor, [[1988 Volvo International|Volvo International]] and [[1988 Livingston Open|Livingston Open]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; and, by December of that year, he had surpassed US$1&amp;nbsp;million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments—the fastest anyone in history had reached that level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1152468/bio|title=Andre Agassi|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1988, he also set the open-era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager (a record that stood for 17 years until [[Rafael Nadal]] broke it in 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Teen Nadal gives Spain reign over French Open |date=June 5, 2006 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/french/2005-06-05-day-14_x.htm |agency=Associated Press (USA Today) |accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His year-end ranking was No. 3, behind second-ranked [[Ivan Lendl]] and top-ranked [[Mats Wilander]]. Both the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] and ''Tennis'' magazine named Agassi the Most Improved Player of the Year for 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;

In addition to not playing the Australian Open (which later became his best Grand Slam event) for the first eight years of his career, Agassi chose not to play at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] from 1988 through 1990 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event's traditionalism, particularly its &quot;predominantly white&quot; dress code to which players at the event are required to conform.

Strong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion. While still a teenager, he reached the semi-finals of both the French Open and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 1988 and made the US Open semi-finals in 1989. He began the 1990s with a series of near-misses. He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he was favored before losing in four sets to [[Andrés Gómez]], which he later attributed in his book to worrying about his wig falling off during the match.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.essentiallysports.com/andre-agassi-says-he-lost-a-grand-slam-final-because-of-his-wig-tennis-news/&lt;/ref&gt; He reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open, defeating defending champion [[Boris Becker]] in the semi-finals. His opponent in the final was [[Pete Sampras]]; a year earlier, Agassi had crushed Sampras, after which time he told his coach that he felt bad for Sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro. Agassi lost the US Open final to Sampras in three sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; The rivalry between these two American players became the biggest one in tennis over the rest of the decade. Agassi ended 1990 on high note as he helped the United States win its first [[Davis Cup]] in 8 years and won his only [[Tennis Masters Cup]], beating reigning Wimbledon champion [[Stefan Edberg]] in the final.

In 1991, Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final, where he faced fellow Bollettieri Academy alumnus [[Jim Courier]]. Courier emerged the victor in a five-set final. Agassi decided to play at Wimbledon in 1991, leading to weeks of speculation in the media about the clothes he would wear. He eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-06-28/sports/1991179074_1_wimbledon-agassi-centre-court |title=Agassi makes a big splash in white on Centre Court |date=June 28, 1991 |publisher=Baltimore The Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reached the quarterfinals on that occasion, losing in five sets to [[David Wheaton]].

Agassi's Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came at Wimbledon, not at the French Open or the US Open, where he had previously enjoyed success. In 1992, he defeated [[Goran Ivanišević]] in a five-set final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/06/sports/tennis-on-the-grass-at-wimbledon-agassi-finally-hits-pay-dirt.html |title=On the Grass at Wimbledon, Agassi Finally Hits Pay Dirt |date=July 6, 1992 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the way, Agassi overcame two former Wimbledon champions: [[Boris Becker]] and [[John McEnroe]]. No other baseliner would triumph at Wimbledon until [[Lleyton Hewitt]] ten years later. Agassi was named the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality|BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]] in 1992. Agassi once again played on the United States' [[Davis Cup]] winning team in 1992. It was their second Davis cup title in three years.

In 1993, Agassi won the only doubles title of his career, at the [[Cincinnati Masters]], partnered with [[Petr Korda]]. He missed much of the early part of that year due to injuries. Although he made the quarterfinals in his Wimbledon title defense, he lost to eventual champion and No. 1 Pete Sampras in five sets. Agassi lost in the first round at the US Open to [[Thomas Enqvist]] and required wrist surgery late in the year.

===1994–1997: Rise to the top, Olympic Gold and the fall===
With new coach [[Brad Gilbert]] on board, Agassi began to employ more of a tactical, consistent approach, which fueled his resurgence. He started slowly in 1994, losing in the first week at the French Open and Wimbledon. Nevertheless, he emerged during the hard-court season, winning the [[Canada Masters|Canadian Open]]. His comeback culminated at the [[1994 US Open (tennis)|1994 US Open]] with a five-set fourth-round victory against [[Michael Chang]]. He then became the first man to capture the US Open as an [[Seed (tennis)|unseeded]] player, beating [[Michael Stich]] in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; Along the way, he beat 5 seeded players.

In 1995, Agassi shaved his balding head, breaking with his old &quot;image is everything&quot; style. He competed in the [[1995 Australian Open]] (his first appearance at the event) and won, beating Sampras in a four-set final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; Agassi and Sampras met in five tournament finals in 1995, all on [[hardcourt]], with Agassi winning three. Agassi won three Masters Series events in 1995 ([[Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati]], [[Miami Masters|Key Biscayne]], and the Canadian Open) and seven titles total.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hard-court circuit, with the last victory being in an intense late night four-set semi-final of the [[1995 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] against [[Boris Becker]]. The streak ended the next day when Agassi lost the final to Sampras.

Agassi reached the [[List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players|world No. 1]] ranking for the first time in April 1995. He held that ranking until November, for a total of 30 weeks. Agassi skipped most of the fall indoor season which allowed Sampras to surpass him and finish ranked No. 1 at the year-end ranking. In terms of win/loss record, 1995 was Agassi's best year. He won 73 and lost 9 matches, and was also once again a key player on the United States' [[Davis Cup]] winning team—the third and final Davis Cup title of his career.

1996 was a less successful year for Agassi, as he failed to reach any Grand Slam final. He suffered two early-round losses to [[Chris Woodruff]] and [[Doug Flach]] at the French Open and Wimbledon, respectively, and lost to Chang in straight sets in the Australian and US Open semi-finals. At the time, Agassi blamed the Australian Open loss on the windy conditions, but later said in his biography that he had lost the match on purpose, as he did not want to play Boris Becker, whom he would have faced in that final. The high point for Agassi was winning the men's singles gold medal at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta]], beating [[Sergi Bruguera]] of Spain in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; Agassi also successfully defended his singles titles in Cincinnati and Key Biscayne.

1997 was the low point of Agassi's career. His wrist injury resurfaced, and he played only 24 matches during the year. He later confessed that he started using [[methamphetamine|crystal methamphetamine]] at that time, allegedly on the urging of a friend.&lt;ref name=&quot;sports.espn.go.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=4600027 |title=Andre Agassi book says he used crystal meth |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He failed an ATP drug test, but wrote a letter claiming the same friend had spiked a drink. The ATP dropped the failed drug test as a warning. In his autobiography, Agassi admitted that the letter was a lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/8329193.stm |work=BBC News |title=Agassi admits use of crystal meth |date=October 28, 2009 |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quit the drug soon after. At this time Agassi was also in a failing marriage with actress, model, and socialite [[Brooke Shields]] and had lost interest in the game.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Agassi interview. ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''. November 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He won no top-level titles, and his ranking sank to No. 141 on November 10, 1997, prompting many to believe that his run as one of the sport's premier competitors was over and he would never again win any significant championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;

===1998–2003: Return to glory and Career Super Slam===
[[File:Andre Agassi 1999.jpg|thumb|Agassi in 1999]]
In 1998, Agassi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in Challenger Series tournaments, a circuit for pro players ranked outside the world's top 50. After returning to top physical and mental shape, Agassi recorded the most successful period of his tennis career and also played classic matches in that period against [[Pete Sampras]] and [[Patrick Rafter]].

In 1998, Agassi won five titles and leapt from No. 110 to No. 6, the highest jump into the top 10 made by any player during a calendar year.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atptennis.com/5/en/players/playerprofiles/highlights.asp?playernumber=A092 |title=Andre Agassi player profile |publisher=Atptennis.com |accessdate=June 6, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Wimbledon, he had an early loss in the second round to [[Tommy Haas]]. He won five titles in ten finals and was runner-up at the [[Miami Masters|Masters Series tournament in Key Biscayne]], losing to [[Marcelo Ríos]], who became No. 1 as a result. At the year end he was awarded the ATP Most Improved Player of the Year for the second time in his career (the first being 10 years earlier in 1988).

Agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat [[Andrei Medvedev]] in a five-set French Open final, becoming, at the time, only the fifth male player (joining [[Rod Laver]], [[Fred Perry]], [[Roy Emerson]] and [[Don Budge]]—these have since been joined by [[Roger Federer]], [[Rafael Nadal]], and [[Novak Djokovic]]) to win all four Grand Slam singles titles during his career. Only Laver, Agassi, Federer, Nadal and Djokovic have achieved this feat during the [[Open Era]]. This win also made him the first (of only four, the next being Federer, Nadal and Djokovic respectively) male player in history to have won all four Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard courts).  Agassi also became the only male player to win the [[Career Super Slam]], consisting of all four Grand Slam tournaments plus an Olympic gold medal in singles and a [[ATP World Tour Finals|Year-End Championship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SI&quot; /&gt;

Agassi followed his 1999 French Open victory by reaching the Wimbledon final, where he lost to Sampras in straight sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He rebounded from his Wimbledon defeat by winning the [[1999 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], beating [[Todd Martin]] in five sets (rallying from a two sets to one deficit) in the final. Overall during the year Agassi won 5 titles including two majors and the ATP Masters Series in Paris, where he beat [[Marat Safin]]. Agassi ended 1999 as the No. 1, ending Sampras's record of six consecutive year-ending top rankings (1993–98).&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; This was the only time Agassi ended the year at No. 1.

He began the next year by capturing his second Australian Open title, beating Sampras in a five-set semi-final and [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] in a four-set final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand Slam finals since [[Rod Laver]] achieved the Grand Slam in 1969.{{#tag:ref|[[Roger Federer]] has since surpassed this feat, reaching ten consecutive Grand Slam finals from 2005 to 2007.|group=lower-alpha}}  At the time, Agassi was also only the fourth player since Laver to be the reigning champion of three of four Grand Slam events, missing only the Wimbledon title.{{#tag:ref|[[Pete Sampras]] held the 1993 Wimbledon, [[1993 US Open (tennis)|1993 US Open]] and [[1994 Australian Open]] titles simultaneously. [[Jimmy Connors]] (1974), [[Roger Federer]] (2004, 2006 and 2007) and [[Novak Djokovic]] (2011) won those three Majors in the same year, although Connors' Grand Slam titles were all played on [[Tennis court#Grass courts|grass courts]]. [[Mats Wilander]] won all but Wimbledon in 1988 during his similar rise to the year-end No. 1. [[Rafael Nadal]] won the French Open and Wimbledon &quot;Channel Slam&quot; (2008) and 2009 Australian Open, before replicating the Channel Slam alongside winning the US Open in 2010.|group=lower-alpha}}. 2000 also saw Agassi reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon, where he lost in five sets to Rafter in a match considered by many to be one of the best ever at Wimbledon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742067.stm |title=Classic Matches: Rafter v Agassi |date=May 31, 2004 |accessdate=October 25, 2007 |work=BBC Sport |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104221251/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742067.stm |archivedate=November 4, 2009 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the inaugural [[2000 Tennis Masters Cup|Tennis Masters Cup]] in Lisbon, Agassi reached the final after defeating Marat Safin in the semi-finals to end the Russian's hopes to become the youngest No. 1 in the history of tennis. Agassi then lost to [[Gustavo Kuerten]] in the final, allowing Kuerten to be crowned year-end No. 1.

Agassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open title with a straight-sets final win over [[Arnaud Clément]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; En route, he beat a cramping Rafter in five sets in front of a sell-out crowd in what turned out to be the Aussie's last Australian Open. At Wimbledon, they met again in the semi-finals, where Agassi lost another close match to Rafter, 8–6 in the fifth set. In the quarterfinals at the US Open, Agassi lost a 3-hour, 33&amp;nbsp;minute epic match&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2001/us_open/news/2001/09/05/sampras_agassi |title=Believe the hype |work=Sports Illustrated |date=September 6, 2001 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604013156/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2001/us_open/news/2001/09/05/sampras_agassi |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Sampras, 7–6, 6–7, 6–7, 6–7,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2001/us_open/news/2001/09/05/agassi_sidebar_ap |title=Unbreakable |date=September 6, 2001 |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no breaks of serve during the 52-game match. Despite the setback, Agassi finished 2001 ranked No. 3, becoming the only male tennis player to finish a year ranked in the top 3 in three different decades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsline.com/tennis/players/playerpage/201490/2006 |title=SportsLine:Andre Agassi |year=2006 |publisher=Sportsline |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1980s, 1990s, 2000s). He was also the oldest player at the time (age 31) to finish in the top three since 32-year-old Connors finished at No. 2 in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt;

2002 opened with disappointment for Agassi, as injury forced him to skip the Australian Open, where he was a two-time defending champion. Agassi recovered from the injury and later that year defended his [[Key Biscayne]] title beating then rising Roger Federer in a four-set final. The last duel between Agassi and Sampras came in the final of the US Open, which Sampras won in four sets and left Sampras with a 20–14 edge in their 34 career meetings. The match was the last of Sampras's career. Agassi's US Open finish, along with his Masters Series victories in Key Biscayne, [[Rome Masters|Rome]] and [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Madrid]], helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end No. 2 at 32 years and 8 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt;

In 2003, Agassi won the eighth (and final) Grand Slam title of his career at the Australian Open, where he beat [[Rainer Schüttler]] in straight sets in the final. In March, he won his sixth career and third consecutive [[Key Biscayne]] title, in the process surpassing his wife, [[Steffi Graf]], who was a five-time winner of the event. The final was his 18th straight win in that tournament, which broke the previous record of 17 set by Sampras from 1993 to 1995. (Agassi's winning streak continued to 20 after winning his first two matches at the 2004 edition of that tournament before bowing to [[Agustín Calleri]].) With the victory, Agassi became the youngest (19 years old) and oldest (32) winner of the Key Biscayne tournament (before Djokovic and Federer overtook him in 2007 and 2017 respectively).

On April 28, 2003, he recaptured the No. 1 ranking after winning the '''[[2003 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships – Singles|U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship]]''' and regained it after a quarterfinal victory over [[Xavier Malisse]] at the [[Queen's Club Championships]] to become the oldest top-ranked male player since the ATP rankings began at 33 years and 13 days. The record was later surpassed by [[Roger Federer]] in 2018. He had held the No. 1 ranking for two weeks, when [[Lleyton Hewitt]] took it back on May 12, 2003. Agassi then recaptured the No. 1 ranking once again on June 16, 2003, which he held for 12 weeks until September 7, 2003. There he managed to reach the US Open semi-finals, where he lost to [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]], surrendering his No. 1 ranking to him. During his career, Agassi held the ranking for a total of 101 weeks. Agassi's ranking slipped when injuries forced him to withdraw from a number of events. At the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, Agassi lost in the final to Federer and finished the year ranked No. 4. At age 33, he had been one of the oldest players to rank in the top 5 since Connors, at age 35, was No. 4 in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt;

===2004–2006: Final years===
In 2004, Agassi began the year with a five-set loss in the semi-finals of the Australian Open to [[Marat Safin]]; the loss ended Agassi's 26-match winning streak at the event. He won the [[Cincinnati Masters|Masters series event in Cincinnati]] to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 ATP Masters Series titles, having already won seven of the nine ATP Masters tournament—all except the tournaments in [[Monte Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo]] and [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]]. At 34, he became the second-oldest singles champion in Cincinnati tournament history (the tournament began in 1899), tied with Roger Federer and surpassed only by [[Ken Rosewall]], who won the title in 1970 at age 35. He finished the year ranked No. 8, one of the oldest players to finish in the top 10 since the 36-year-old Connors was No. 7 in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt; At the time, Agassi also became the sixth male player during the [[Tennis open era|open era]] to reach 800 career wins with his first-round victory over [[Alex Bogomolov]] in [[Countrywide Classic]] in Los Angeles.

Agassi's 2005 began with a quarterfinal loss to Federer at the Australian Open. Agassi had several other deep runs at tournaments, but had to withdraw from several events due to injury. He lost to [[Jarkko Nieminen]] in the first round of the French Open. He won his fourth title in Los Angeles and reached the final of the [[Canada Masters|Rogers Cup]], before falling to No. 2 [[Rafael Nadal]].

Agassi's 2005 was defined by an improbable run to the US Open final. After beating [[Răzvan Sabău]] and [[Ivo Karlović]] in straight sets and [[Tomáš Berdych]] in four sets, Agassi won three consecutive five-set matches to advance to the final. The most notable of these matches was his quarterfinal victory over [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]], where he rallied from two sets down to win in the fifth set tie-breaker. His other five-set victories were on [[Xavier Malisse]] in the fourth round and [[Robby Ginepri]] in the semi-finals. In the final, Agassi faced Federer, who was seeking his second consecutive US Open title and his sixth Grand Slam title in two years. Federer defeated Agassi in four sets. Agassi finished 2005 ranked No. 7, his 16th time in the year-end top-10 rankings, which tied Connors for the most times ranked in the top 10 at year's end.

Agassi had a poor start to 2006, as he was still recovering from an ankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play. Agassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of the ankle injury, and his back injury and other pains forced him to withdraw from several other events, eventually skipping the entire clay-court season including the French Open. This caused his ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the last time. Agassi returned for the grass-court season, playing a tune-up, and then [[2006 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon]]. He was defeated in the third round by world No. 2 (and eventual runner-up) [[Rafael Nadal]]. Against conventions, Agassi, the losing player, was interviewed on court after the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13653101 |title=Upsetting day: Agassi, then Roddick ousted |date=June 1, 2006 |accessdate=October 27, 2007 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NBC Sports |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105214848/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13653101 |archivedate=November 5, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Wimbledon, Agassi announced his plans to retire following the US Open. Agassi played only two events during the summer hard-court season with his best result being a quarterfinal loss at the [[Countrywide Classic]] in Los Angeles to [[Fernando González]] of Chile, which resulted in him being unseeded at the US Open.

Agassi had a short, but dramatic, run in his final US Open. Because of extreme back pain, Agassi was forced to receive anti-inflammatory injections after every match. After a tough four-set win against [[Andrei Pavel]], Agassi faced eighth-seeded [[Marcos Baghdatis]] in the second round who had earlier advanced to the [[2006 Australian Open]] final and Wimbledon semi-finals. Agassi won in five tough sets as the younger Baghdatis succumbed to muscle cramping in the final set. In his last match, Agassi fell to 112th-ranked big-serving [[Benjamin Becker]] of Germany in four sets. Agassi received a four-minute standing ovation from the crowd after the match and delivered a retirement speech.

==Rivalries==

===Agassi vs. Sampras===
{{Main|Agassi–Sampras rivalry}}
The rivalry has been called the greatest of the generation of players competing in the 90's, as [[Pete Sampras|Sampras]] and Agassi were the most successful players of that decade. They also had very contrasting playing styles, with Sampras being considered the greatest [[serve (tennis)|server]] and Agassi the greatest serve returner at the time. Agassi and Sampras met 34 times on the tour level with Agassi trailing 14–20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atptennis.com/3/en/players/headtohead/?player1=Sampras%2C+Pete&amp;player2=agassi |title=Sampras-Agassi Head-to-Head Matches |work=ATP Official website |accessdate=November 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1990 U.S. Open (tennis)|1990 US Open]] was their first meeting in a Grand Slam tournament final. Agassi was favored as he was ranked No. 4 at the time, compared to the No. 12 ranking of Sampras and because Agassi had defeated Sampras in their only previously completed match. Agassi, however, lost the final to Sampras in straight sets. Their next meeting in a Grand Slam was at the [[1992 French Open]], where they met in the quarterfinals. Although Sampras was ranked higher, Agassi came out winning in straight sets. They met again on a Grand Slam level at the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in 1993, where Agassi was the defending champion and Sampras was the newly minted world No. 1. Agassi dug himself out from a two-sets-to-love hole, levelling the match at 2 sets apiece; however, Sampras prevailed in five sets, and went on to win his first Wimbledon championship.

With both Sampras and Agassi participating, the [[USA Davis Cup team|US]] won the Davis Cup in 1995. The year should be considered the peak of the rivalry as together they won 3 out of 4 major titles, meeting each other twice in the finals, and were occupying the top two spots in the rankings for the whole year. They met 5 times during the year, all in the title matches, including the [[1995 Australian Open|Australian Open]], the [[Indian Wells Masters|Newsweek Champions Cup]] (now Indian Wells), the [[Lipton International Players Championships]] (now Miami Open), the [[Canada Masters|Canadian Open]], and the [[1995 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. Agassi won three of the finals, including the Australian Open; however, Sampras took the US Open title, ending Agassi's 26-match winning streak. After Agassi had taken most of the fall season off, Sampras took over the No. 1 ranking for the end of the season.

In the following 3 years, while Sampras continued winning Grand Slam titles every season, Agassi slumped in the rankings and struggled in major competitions. The next time Sampras and Agassi met in a Grand Slam final was at Wimbledon in 1999, where Sampras won in straight sets. For both, it was considered a career rejuvenation, as Sampras had suffered a string of disappointments in the previous year while Agassi was regaining his status as a top-ranked player after winning the French Open. Sampras forfeited the No. 1 ranking to Agassi when injury forced him to withdraw from that year's US Open, which Agassi went on to win. They faced each other twice in the season-ending [[Tennis Masters Cup|ATP Tour World Championships]], with Sampras losing the round-robin match, but winning the final.

In the 2000s, they met three more times on the Grand Slam level offering three memorable contests. In 2000, the top-ranked Agassi defeated No. 3 Sampras in the semi-finals of the [[2000 Australian Open|Australian Open]] in five sets, which was an important win for Agassi who had lost 4 of the previous 5 matches against Sampras. In arguably their most memorable match ever, Sampras defeated Agassi in the [[2001 U.S. Open (tennis)|2001 US Open]] quarterfinals in four sets. There were no breaks of serve during the entire match. Reruns of the match are frequently featured on television, especially during US Open rain delays, and the match is considered one of the best in history because of the level of play presented by both players.

Their last meeting was the final of the [[2002 U.S. Open (tennis)|2002 US Open]], which was their third meeting in a US Open final, but the first since 1995. The match was also notable because they had defeated several up-and-coming players en route to the final. Sampras had defeated No. 3 [[Tommy Haas]] in the fourth round and future No. 1 [[Andy Roddick]] in the quarterfinals, while Agassi had defeated No. 1 and defending champion [[Lleyton Hewitt]] in the semi-finals. Sampras defeated Agassi in four sets. This was the final [[ATP tour]] singles match of Sampras's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Muir |first=Allan |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2002/us_open/news/2002/09/07/agassi_hewitt/ |title=Breaking news, real-time scores and daily analysis from Sports Illustrated – SI.com |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021101220644/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2002/us_open/news/2002/09/07/agassi_hewitt/ |archive-date=November 1, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agassi vs. Chang===

[[Michael Chang]] was the opponent Agassi faced most frequently from all the players other than Sampras. They met 22 times on the tour level with Agassi leading 15–7. Chang, unlike most of Agassi's big rivals, had a playing style similar to his. Both players preferred to stay at the baseline with Chang being more defensive-minded. The outcome was that most of their meetings were built on long and entertaining rallies. The rivalry began late in the 1980s with both players being considered the prodigies of the next great generation of American tennis players and both having foreign descent.

Agassi won the first four matches including a straight-set victory in round 16 of the 1988 US Open and defeating Chang, the defending champion, in the 1990 French Open in a four-set quarterfinal. Arguably their best match took place in round 16 of the 1994 US Open. While both players presented high-quality shot-making, the momentum changed from set to set with Agassi eventually prevailing in a five-set victory. It turned out to be the toughest contest on his way to his first US Open title. Their next two Grand Slam meetings came in 1996, with Chang recording easy straight-set victories in the semi-finals of both the Australian Open and the US Open. Years after, Agassi shockingly admitted in his book that he had lost the first of the matches on purpose as he did not want to face Boris Becker, who was awaiting the winner in the final. Agassi won the last four of their matches, with the last being in 2003 at the Miami Open with Chang being clearly past his prime.

===Agassi vs. Becker===

[[Boris Becker]] and Agassi played 14 times with Agassi leading 10–4. Becker won their first three matches in 1988 and 1989 before Agassi reversed the rivalry in 1990, and won 10 of their last 11 matches. They first played at Indian Wells in 1988, with Becker prevailing. Their most notable match was the 1989 [[Davis Cup]] semi-final match, which Becker won in five sets after losing the first two in tiebreaks. Agassi, considered a baseliner with a playing style not suiting grass, shocked Becker, a three-time champion, in a five-set quarterfinal at Wimbledon in 1992 on his way to his first Grand Slam title. The intensity of the rivalry peaked in 1995. Becker won that year's Wimbledon semi-final after being down a set and two breaks, to eventually win in four sets. In a highly anticipated rematch in the US Open semi-final, this time it was Agassi who came out victorious in four tight sets. Their final match was played at Hong Kong in 1999, which Agassi won in three sets.

===Agassi vs. Rafter===

Agassi and [[Pat Rafter]] played fifteen times with Agassi leading 10–5. The rivalry has been considered special and delivered memorable encounters, because of the players' contrasting styles of play, with Rafter using traditional serve-&amp;-volley methods against Agassi's variety of return of serves and passing shots as his main weapons. Agassi led 8–2 on hard courts, but Rafter surprisingly won their sole match on clay at the [[1999 Italian Open (tennis)|1999 Rome Masters]]. They played four matches at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] with both winning two matches each. Agassi won the first two in 1993 and 1999, while Rafter took their 2000 and 2001 encounters, both of the gruelling 5-setters often being presented on the lists of best matches ever played. Agassi also won both their meetings at the Australian Open, in 1995 and 2001, on his way to the title on both occasions. Rafter, however, took their only US Open encounter in 1997 and went on to win the title.

===Agassi vs. Federer===

Agassi and [[Roger Federer]] played 11 times, and Federer led their head-to-head series 8–3. With the retirement of Sampras, the rivalry against the 11-years-younger Federer, who was another great server like Sampras, became Agassi's main rivalry for the final years of his career. Agassi won their first three matches, but then went on to lose eight consecutive ones. They first met in just the third tournament of Federer's career at the 1998 Swiss Indoors in Federer's hometown, with Agassi prevailing over the 17-year-old. Agassi also defeated Federer at the [[2001 US Open (tennis)|2001 US Open]] and the finals of the [[Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Open]] in 2002. Federer began to turn the tide at the Masters Cup in 2003, when he defeated Agassi in both the round robin and the final. They played a memorable quarterfinal match at the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|2004 US Open]] that spanned over two windy days, with Federer eventually prevailing in five sets. At the 2005 Dubai Championships, Federer and Agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends play on a helipad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel Burj al-Arab. Their final duel took place in the final of the [[2005 US Open (tennis)|2005 US Open]]. In the historic clash of generations, Federer was victorious in four sets in front of a pro-Agassi crowd. The match was the last appearance by Agassi in any tournament final.

===Agassi vs. Lendl===

Agassi and [[Ivan Lendl]] played 8 times, and Lendl led their head-to-head series 6–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atptour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/ivan-lendl-vs-andre-agassi/L018/A092|title=Ivan Lendl VS Andre Agassi &amp;#124; Tennis|website=ATP Tour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earnings==
Agassi earned more than $30&amp;nbsp;million in prize-money during his career, sixth only to Djokovic, Federer, Nadal, Sampras and Murray to date (May 2018). He also earned more than $25&amp;nbsp;million a year through endorsements during his career, which was ranked fourth in all sports at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/53/1YUQ.html |title=Forbes:Andre Agassi |work=Forbes |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, in [[Macau]] Agassi and Sampras met for the first time on court since the 2002 US Open final. Sampras won the exhibition in three sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/news/113944-sampras-beats-agassi-in-macau-exhibition |title=Sampras beats Agassi in Macau exhibition |publisher=NDTV Sports |accessdate=May 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610183932/http://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/news/113944-sampras-beats-agassi-in-macau-exhibition |archive-date=June 10, 2014 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry between the former champions headlined sports media again in March 2010 after the two participated in the &quot;Hit for Haiti&quot; charity event organized to raise money for the victims of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake]]. Partnered with Roger Federer and [[Rafael Nadal]], the old rivals began making jokes at each other's expense, which ended up with Sampras intentionally striking a serve at Agassi's body. After the event, Agassi admitted that he had crossed the line with his jokes and publicly apologized to Sampras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/mar/16/andre-agassi-apologises-pete-sampras |title=Andre Agassi apologises for mocking Pete Sampras in charity match |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agassi and Sampras met again one year later for an exhibition match at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York in front of 19 000 spectators as Sampras defeated Agassi in two sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/sports/tennis/01tennis.html|title=Agassi and Sampras Meet a Year After Flare-Up |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 1, 2011 |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 3, 2014, Agassi and Sampras squared off for an exhibition in London for the annual [[World Tennis Day]].

==Playing style==
Early in his career, Agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first-strike tennis, typically by inducing a weak return with a deep, hard shot, and then playing a winner at an extreme angle. On the rare occasion that he charged the net, Agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for a winner. His favored groundstroke was his flat, accurate two-handed backhand, hit well cross-court but especially down the line. His forehand was nearly as strong, especially his inside-out to the ad court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =Nick Bollettieri |url=http://www.tennisplayer.net/public/tour_strokes/nick_bollettieri/nick_bollet_agassi_backhand_images/nick_bollet_agassi_backhand.html?format=print |title=Building the Agassi Backhand |website=tennisplayer.net |accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agassi's strength was in dictating play from the baseline, and he was able to consistently take the ball on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1783460-rafael-nadal-vs-andre-agassi-was-a-transition-of-tennis-generations|title=Rafael Nadal vs. Andre Agassi Was a Transition of Tennis Generations|website=Bleacher Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was growing up, his father and Nick Bollettieri trained him in this way.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Open: Andre Agassi HarpersCollins 2009&lt;/ref&gt; When in control of a point, Agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors, and to make his opponent run more. This change to more methodical, less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach, Brad Gilbert, in their first year together in 1994. Gilbert encouraged Agassi to wear out opponents with his deep, flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars, and noted Agassi's two-handed backhand down the line as his very best shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; A signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes. This would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it.

Agassi was raised on hardcourts, but found much of his early major-tournament success on the red clay of Roland Garros, reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career. Despite grass being his worst surface, his first major win was at the slick grass of Wimbledon in 1992, a tournament that he professed to hating at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; His strongest surface over the course of his career, was indeed hardcourt, where he won six of his eight majors.

==Business ventures==
Agassi established a [[limited liability company]] named Andre Agassi Ventures (formerly named Agassi Enterprises).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/rogers-steps-down-as-agassi-enterprises-president/ |title=Rogers steps down as Agassi Enterprises president |newspaper=Las Vegas Review Journal |date=October 16, 2008 |accessdate=September 9, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512181941/https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/rogers-steps-down-as-agassi-enterprises-president/ |archive-date=May 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agassi, along with five athlete partners (including [[Wayne Gretzky]], [[Joe Montana]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]], and [[Monica Seles]]) opened a chain of sports-themed restaurant named [[Official All Star Café]] in April 1996.

===Autobiography===
Agassi's autobiography, ''Open: An Autobiography,'' (written with assistance from [[J. R. Moehringer]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/books/09book.html?_r=1 &quot;Agassi Basks in His Own Spotlight&quot; by Janet Malin ''New York Times'' November 8, 2009]. Retrieved December 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;), was published in November 2009. In it, Agassi opens up about his childhood or having to grow up with a very unconventional Armenian father who came to the United States from Iran where he was a professional boxer.  Overly demanding and emotionally abusive to the whole family, his father groomed young Agassi for tennis greatness by building a tennis court in their backyard and sending Agassi to tennis boarding school under the supervision of Nick Bollettieri, who later coached and managed part of Agassi's professional career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/books/review/Tanenhaus-t.html|title=Andre Agassi's Hate of the Game|newspaper= The New York Times|first=SAM|last=TANENHAUSNOV|date=November 20, 2009|access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agassi's struggle to cope throughout his youth while he was forced to be away from his family and friends at such a young age, to become a top-rated player and celebrity, to build a team that he can trust, to fight on the court physically and emotionally for every point, to succeed in so many games but also experience devastating defeats across unrelenting rivals – this is all meticulously detailed in his autobiography.

There is also mention in the book of using and testing positive for [[methamphetamine]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;sports.espn.go.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2009/10/27/2009-10-27_agassi.html |location=New York |work=Daily News |title=Andre Agassi admits to using crystal meth in forthcoming autobiography |first=Nathaniel |last=Vinton |date=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/sports/NATL-Andre-Agassi-Admits-to-Using-Crystal-Meth-66510482.html |title=Andre Agassi Admits to Using Crystal Meth |date=October 27, 2009 |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this revelation, [[Roger Federer]] declared himself shocked and disappointed, while [[Marat Safin]] argued that Agassi should return his prize money and be stripped of his titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sport.repubblica.it/news/sport/tennis-federer-deluso-e-scioccato-da-agassi/3730572.html |title=TENNIS, FEDERER: DELUSO E SCIOCCATO DA AGASSI |language=it |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/10/andre-agassi-marat-safin-drugs |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=Marat Safin tells Andre Agassi to relinquish titles after drug admission |date=November 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with CBS, Agassi justified himself and asked for understanding, saying that &quot;It was a period in my life where I needed help.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportmediaset.mediaset.it/altrisport/articoli/articolo27870.shtml |title=Agassi: &quot;Ora chiedo comprensione&quot;.

Agassi said that he had always hated tennis during his career because of the constant pressure it exerted on him.

==Philanthropy==
Agassi founded the [[Andre Agassi Charitable Association]] in 1994, which assists Las Vegas' young people. He was awarded the [[ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian award]] in 1995 for his efforts to help disadvantaged youth. He has been cited as the most charitable and socially involved player in professional tennis. It has also been claimed that he may be the most charitable athlete of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackvoices.com/black_sports/columnists/roysjohnson/_a/sportsmanperson-of-the-year/20061002123009990001 |title=Sportsman/Person of the Year |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agassi's charities help in assisting children reach their athletic potential. His Boys &amp; Girls Club sees 2,000 children throughout the year and boasts a world-class junior tennis team. It also has a basketball program (the Agassi Stars) and a rigorous system that encourages a mix of academics and athletics.

In 2001, Agassi opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy&lt;ref name=Prep&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agassiprep.org |title=Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy |accessdate=January 26, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211235357/http://agassiprep.org/ |archivedate=February 11, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Las Vegas, a tuition-free charter school for at-risk children in the area. He personally donated $35&amp;nbsp;million to the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2006/03/20060306/Opinion/Stern-NBA-Make-Doing-Well-By-Doing-Good-Contagious.aspx |title=Stern, NBA make doing well by doing good contagious |publisher=SportsBusiness Journal |date=March 6, 2006 |first=Marc |last=Pollick |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the graduating class had a 100 percent graduation rate and expected a 100 percent college acceptance rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Karen |url=http://www.cw.edu/page.php?subj=about&amp;page=president-blog&amp;id=20 |title=CW President's Blog |publisher=[[College of Westchester]] |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719183024/http://www.cw.edu/page.php?subj=about&amp;page=president-blog&amp;id=20 |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other child-related programs that Agassi supports through his Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation is Clark County's only residential facility for abused and neglected children, Child Haven. In 1997, Agassi donated funding to Child Haven for a six-room classroom building now named the Agassi Center for Education. His foundation also provided $720,000 to assist in the building of the Andre Agassi Cottage for Medically Fragile Children. This 20-bed facility opened in December 2001, and accommodates developmentally delayed or handicapped children and children quarantined for infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.athlete.com/profile.php?id=351 |title=Andre Agassi |publisher=Athlete.com |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707182451/http://www.athlete.com/profile.php?id=351 |archivedate=July 7, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, along with several other athletes, Agassi founded the charity [[Athletes for Hope]], which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and aims to inspire all people to volunteer and support their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.athletesforhope.org/history.html |publisher=[[Athletes for Hope]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created the Canyon-Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund, now known as the Turner-Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund. The Fund is an investment initiative for social change, focusing on the &quot;nationwide effort to move charters from stopgap buildings into permanent campuses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/agassi-school-fund-makes-first-investment-in-las-vegas/|title=Agassi school fund makes first investment in Las Vegas|date=February 3, 2014|website=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=February 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, the Andre Agassi Foundation for Education formed a partnership with V20 Foods to launch Box Budd!es, a line of kids' healthy snacks. All proceeds go to the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/food-thought-agassis-box-buddes-raises-educations-funds-healthful-snacks |title=Food for thought: Agassi's Box Budd!es raises educations funds with healthful snacks |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |date=October 7, 2013 |first=Laura |last=Carroll |accessdate=September 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911152745/http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/food-thought-agassis-box-buddes-raises-educations-funds-healthful-snacks |archive-date=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Manufacturers/Andre-Agassi-teams-up-with-V20-Foods-to-launch-Box-Budd!es-snacks-for-kids |title=Andre Agassi teams up with V20 Foods to launch Box Budd!es snacks for kids |publisher=Foodnavigator-usa.com |date=September 25, 2013 |first=Elaine |last=Watson |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Agassi remodeled the vacant [[University of Phoenix]] building as a new school called the Doral Academy West through the Canyon-Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund. Doral Academy opened in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/agassi-school-fund-makes-first-investment-las-vegas |title=Agassi school fund makes first investment in Las Vegas |newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=February 2, 2014 |first=Jennifer |last=Robinson |accessdate=September 10, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726215916/http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/agassi-school-fund-makes-first-investment-las-vegas |archive-date=July 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fund purchased a 4.6-acre plot in [[Henderson, Nevada]] to house the Somerset Academy of Las Vegas, which will relocate from its campus inside a church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/canyon-agassi-group-buys-46-acre-plot-academy |title=Canyon-Agassi group buys 4.6-acre plot for academy |newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=February 7, 2014 |accessdate=September 10, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195401/http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/canyon-agassi-group-buys-46-acre-plot-academy |archive-date=September 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Austroasiatic languages'''{{refn|group=note|Sometimes also as ''Austro-Asiatic'' or ''Austroasian''}} {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɔː|s|t|r|oʊ|.|eɪ|ʒ|i|ˈ|æ|t|ɪ|k}}, also known as '''Mon–Khmer'''&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2012) notes, ''MK in the wider sense including the Munda languages of eastern South Asia is also known as Austroasiatic.''&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|m|oʊ|n|ˌ|k|ə|ˈ|m|ɛər}}, are a large [[language family]] of [[Mainland Southeast Asia]], also scattered throughout parts of [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], and southern [[China]]. There are around 117 million speakers of Austroasiatic languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Austroasiatic.html|title=Austroasiatic|website=www.languagesgulper.com|language=en|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these languages, only [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Mon language|Mon]] have a long-established recorded history and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status as modern [[national language]]s (in [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]], respectively).  The Mon language is a recognised indigenous language in [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]]. In Myanmar, the [[Wa language]] is the de facto official language of [[Wa State]]. [[Santali language|Santali]] is one of the 22 [[Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India|scheduled languages of India]]. The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status.

''[[Ethnologue]]'' identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages. These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps [[Shompen language|Shompen]], which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally been grouped into two, as Mon–Khmer and [[Munda languages|Munda]]. However, one recent classification posits three groups (Munda, Nuclear Mon-Khmer and [[Khasi–Khmuic languages|Khasi–Khmuic]]),&lt;ref&gt;Diffloth 2005&lt;/ref&gt; while another has abandoned Mon–Khmer as a taxon altogether, making it synonymous with the larger family.&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across Southeast Asia and parts of India, Bangladesh, Nepal and East Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken. They appear to be the extant [[autochthonous language]]s of Mainland Southeast Asia (excluding the [[Andaman Islands]]), with the neighboring [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]], [[Hmong-Mien languages|Hmong-Mien]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] being the result of later migrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;SidwellBlench2011&quot; /&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''Austroasiatic'' comes from a combination of the [[Latin]] words for &quot;South&quot; and &quot;Asia&quot;, hence &quot;South Asia&quot;.

==Typology==
Regarding word structure, Austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic [[sesquisyllable|&quot;sesquisyllabic&quot;]] pattern, with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial, unstressed, reduced [[minor syllable]] followed by a stressed, full syllable.{{sfn|Alves|2014|p=524}} This reduction of presyllables has led to a variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original Proto-Austroasiatic prefixes, such as the causative prefix, ranging from CVC syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants.{{sfn|Alves|2014|p=526}} As for word formation, most Austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes, many have [[infix]]es, but suffixes are almost completely non-existent in most branches except Munda, and a few specialized exceptions in other Austroasiatic branches.&lt;ref&gt;Alves 2014, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of [[Register (phonology)|register]] contrast, either between [[modal voice|modal]] (normal) voice and [[breathy voice|breathy]] (lax) voice or between modal voice and [[creaky voice]].&lt;ref&gt;Diffloth, Gérard (1989). [http://www.sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/15:139-154.pdf &quot;Proto-Austroasiatic creaky voice.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Languages in the Pearic branch and some in the Vietic branch can have a three- or even four-way voicing contrast.

However, some Austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases, such as Vietnamese, [[tonogenesis]]. Vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by Chinese that its original Austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of South Chinese languages, whereas Khmer, which had more influence from Sanskrit, has retained a more typically Austroasiatic structure.

==Proto-language==
{{Main|Proto-Austroasiatic language}}
Much work has been done on the reconstruction of [[Proto-Mon–Khmer]] in [[Harry L. Shorto]]'s ''Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary''. Little work has been done on the [[Munda languages]], which are not well documented. With their demotion from a primary branch, Proto-Mon–Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic. Paul Sidwell (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon–Khmer as follows:{{sfnp|Sidwell|2005|p=196}}

{| class=&quot;IPA wikitable&quot;
|-
| *p || *t || *c || *k || *ʔ
|-
| *b || *d || *ɟ || *ɡ ||
|-
| *ɓ || *ɗ || *ʄ || ||
|-
| *m || *n || *ɲ || *ŋ ||
|-
| *w || *l, *r || *j || ||
|-
| || *s || || || *h
|}
This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for {{IPA|*ʄ}}.  {{IPA|*ʄ}} is better preserved in the [[Katuic languages]], which Sidwell has specialized in.

==Internal classification==
Linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic: the [[Mon–Khmer languages]] of [[Southeast Asia]], [[North-East India|Northeast India]] and the [[Nicobar Islands]], and the [[Munda languages]] of [[East India|East]] and [[Central India]] and parts of [[Bangladesh]], parts of [[Nepal]]. However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published.

Each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade.{{clarify|date=February 2016}} By contrast, the relationships ''between'' these families within Austroasiatic are debated. In addition to the traditional classification, two recent proposals are given, neither of which accepts traditional &quot;Mon–Khmer&quot; as a valid unit. However, little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review.

In addition, there are suggestions that additional branches of Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] in Sumatra (Diffloth), the [[Chamic languages]] of Vietnam, and the [[Land Dayak languages]] of Borneo (Adelaar 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench, ''2009. Are there four additional unrecognised branches of Austroasiatic?'' Presentation at ICAAL-4, Bangkok, 29–30 October. Summarized in Sidwell and Blench (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diffloth (1974)===
[[Gérard Diffloth|Diffloth]]'s widely cited original classification, now abandoned by Diffloth himself, is used in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and—except for the breakup of Southern Mon–Khmer—in ''Ethnologue.''

=== Peiros (2004) ===
Peiros is a [[lexicostatistics|lexicostatistic]] classification, based on percentages of shared vocabulary. This means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to [[language contact]]. Indeed, when Sidwell (2009) replicated Peiros's study with languages known well enough to account for loans, he did not find the internal (branching) structure below.

=== Sidwell (2009, 2011) ===
[[File:Mekong river basin.png|thumb|right|upright=1.81|[[Paul Sidwell]] and [[Roger Blench]] propose that the Austroasiatic phylum dispersed via the [[Mekong]] River [[drainage basin]].]]
[[Paul Sidwell]] (2009), in a [[lexicostatistical]] comparison of 36 languages which are well known enough to exclude loan words, finds little evidence for internal branching, though he did find an area of increased contact between the Bahnaric and Katuic languages, such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant [[Munda languages|Munda]] and Nicobarese show greater similarity to Bahnaric and Katuic the closer they are to those branches, without any noticeable innovations common to Bahnaric and Katuic.

He therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence. Sidwell &amp; [[Roger Blench|Blench]] (2011) discuss this proposal in more detail, and note that there is good evidence for a Khasi–Palaungic node, which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic.&lt;ref name=&quot;SidwellBlench2011&quot;&gt;Sidwell, Paul, and Roger Blench. 2011. &quot;[http://rogerblench.info/Archaeology/SE%20Asia/SR09/Sidwell%20Blench%20offprint.pdf The Austroasiatic Urheimat: the Southeastern Riverine Hypothesis].&quot; Enfield, NJ (ed.) ''Dynamics of Human Diversity'', 317–345. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

If this would the case, Sidwell &amp; Blench suggest that Khasic may have been an early offshoot of Palaungic that had spread westward. Sidwell &amp; Blench (2011) suggest [[Shompen language|Shompen]] as an additional branch, and believe that a Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating. In general, however, the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed, since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers are believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central [[Mekong]] river valley relatively quickly.

Subsequently, Sidwell (2015a: 179)&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2015a. &quot;Austroasiatic classification.&quot; In Jenny, Mathias and Paul Sidwell, eds (2015). ''The Handbook of Austroasiatic Languages''. Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that [[Nicobarese languages|Nicobarese]] subgroups with [[Aslian languages|Aslian]], just as how Khasian and Palaungic subgroup with each other. A subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis of the Austroasiatic language family by Sidwell (2015b)&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2015b. [https://www.eva.mpg.de/fileadmin/content_files/linguistics/conferences/2015-diversity-linguistics/Sidwell_slides.pdf A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the Austroasiatic languages]. Presented at Diversity Linguistics: Retrospect and Prospect, 1–3 May 2015 (Leipzig, Germany), Closing conference of the Department of Linguistics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Austroasiatic branches may have a loosely nested structure rather than a completely rake-like structure, with an east–west division (consisting of Munda, Khasic, Palaungic, and Khmuic forming a western group as opposed to all of the other branches) occurring possibly as early as 7,000 years before present.

Integrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings, Paul Sidwell (2015c)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2015&quot;&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2015c. ''Phylogeny, innovations, and correlations in the prehistory of Austroasiatic''. Paper presented at the workshop ''Integrating inferences about our past: new findings and current issues in the peopling of the Pacific and South East Asia'', 22 – 23 June 2015, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; further expanded his Mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that Austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into [[Indochina]] from the [[Lingnan]] area of [[southern China]], with the subsequent Mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of Neolithic farmers from southern China.

Sidwell (2015c) tentatively suggests that Austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5,000 years B.P. during the [[Neolithic transition]] era of [[mainland Southeast Asia]], with all the major branches of Austroasiatic formed by 4,000 B.P. Austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] watershed of [[Lingnan]], which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of Vietnam, or downstream through the [[Mekong River]] via [[Yunnan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2015&quot;/&gt; Both the reconstructed lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early Austroasiatic speakers around 4,000 B.P. cultivated rice and [[millet]], kept livestock such as dogs, pigs, and chickens, and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2015&quot;/&gt;

At 4,500 B.P., this &quot;Neolithic package&quot; suddenly arrived in Indochina from the Lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer cultures, with grain husks found in northern Indochina by 4,100 B.P. and in southern Indochina by 3,800 B.P.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2015&quot;/&gt; However, Sidwell (2015c) found that iron is not reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic, since each Austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from Tai, Chinese, Tibetan, Malay, and other languages.

During the [[Iron Age]] about 2,500 B.P., relatively young Austroasiatic branches in Indochina such as [[Vietic languages|Vietic]], [[Katuic languages|Katuic]], [[Pearic languages|Pearic]], and [[Khmer language|Khmer]] were formed, while the more internally diverse [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] branch (dating to about 3,000 B.P.) underwent more extensive internal diversification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2015&quot;/&gt; By the Iron Age, all of the Austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present-day locations, with most of the diversification within Austroasiatic taking place during the Iron Age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2015&quot;/&gt;

Paul Sidwell (2018)&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2018. ''Austroasiatic deep chronology and the problem of cultural lexicon''. Paper presented at the 28th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society, held 17–19 May 2018 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.&lt;/ref&gt; considers the Austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years B.P. during the arrival of rice agriculture in Indochina, but notes that the origin of Proto-Austroasiatic itself is older than that date. The lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum. The early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts, animal names, natural features, and pronouns, while the names of cultural items (agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts, which are reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic) form part of the later stratum.

[[Roger Blench]] (2017)&lt;ref name=&quot;Blench2017&quot;&gt;Blench, Roger. 2017. ''[http://southasiabibliography.de/uploads/Blench.pdf Waterworld: lexical evidence for aquatic subsistence strategies in Austroasiatic]''. Presented at ICAAL 7, Kiel, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies (such as boats, waterways, river fauna, and fish capture techniques), can be reconstructed for Proto-Austroasiatic. Blench (2017) finds widespread Austroasiatic roots for 'river, valley', 'boat', 'fish', 'catfish sp.', 'eel', 'prawn', 'shrimp' (Central Austroasiatic), 'crab', 'tortoise', 'turtle', 'otter', 'crocodile', 'heron, fishing bird', and 'fish trap'. Archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern [[Indochina]] (northern Vietnam, Laos, and other nearby areas) dates back to only about 4,000 years B.P. (2,000 BC), with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the Yangtze valley where it has been dated to 6,000 B.P.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blench2017&quot;/&gt;

Hence, this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of Austroasiatic as compared to [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], whose speakers had a distinct non-riverine culture. In addition to living an aquatic-based lifestyle, early Austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock, crops, and newer types of watercraft. As early Austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways, they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area, such as Sino-Tibetan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blench2017&quot;/&gt;

=== Possible extinct branches ===
[[Roger Blench]] (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2009. &quot;[http://icaal.org/abstract/blench-are.html Are there four additional unrecognised branches of Austroasiatic?].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of Austroasiatic that are now extinct, based on [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrate]] evidence in modern-day languages.
* '''Pre-[[Chamic language|Chamic]] languages''' (the languages of coastal Vietnam prior to the Chamic migrations). Chamic has various Austroasiatic loanwords that cannot be clearly traced to existing Austroasiatic branches (Sidwell 2006, 2007).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2006&quot;&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2006. &quot;[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/sidwell2006dating.pdf Dating the Separation of Acehnese and Chamic By Etymological Analysis of the Aceh-Chamic Lexicon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108030716/http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/sidwell2006dating.pdf |date=8 November 2014 }}.&quot; In The ''Mon-Khmer Studies Journal'', 36: 187–206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2007&quot;&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2007. &quot;[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/sidwell2002mon-khmer.pdf The Mon-Khmer Substrate in Chamic: Chamic, Bahnaric and Katuic Contact].&quot; In SEALS XII Papers from the 12th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society 2002, edited by Ratree Wayland et al..

''The Position of Moken and Moklen Within the Austronesian Language Family''. Doctoral dissertation, University of Hawai'i at Mānoa.&lt;/ref&gt; also notes that [[Moklenic languages]] contain many Austroasiatic loanwords, some of which are similar to the ones found in Chamic.
* '''[[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] substratum''' (Sidwell 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2006&quot; /&gt; Acehnese has many basic words that are of Austroasiatic origin, suggesting that either Austronesian speakers have absorbed earlier Austroasiatic residents in northern Sumatra, or that words might have been borrowed from Austroasiatic languages in southern Vietnam – or perhaps a combination of both. Sidwell (2006) argues that Acehnese and Chamic had often borrowed Austroasiatic words independently of each other, while some Austroasiatic words can be traced back to Proto-Aceh-Chamic. Sidwell (2006) accepts that Acehnese and Chamic are related, but that they had separated from each other before Chamic had borrowed most of its Austroasiatic lexicon.
* '''[[Bornean languages|Bornean]] substrate languages''' (Blench 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2010. &quot;[https://digital.lib.washington.edu/ojs/index.php/BIPPA/article/viewFile/10637/10669 Was there an Austroasiatic Presence in Island Southeast Asia prior to the Austronesian Expansion?]&quot; In ''Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association'', Vol. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Blench cites Austroasiatic-origin words in modern-day Bornean branches such as [[Land Dayak languages|Land Dayak]] ([[Bidayuh languages|Bidayuh]], [[Bakati’ language|Dayak Bakatiq]], etc.), [[Dusunic languages|Dusunic]] ([[Dusun language|Central Dusun]], [[Brunei Bisaya language|Visayan]], etc.), [[Kayan–Murik languages|Kayan]], and [[Kenyah languages|Kenyah]], noting especially resemblances with [[Aslian languages|Aslian]]. As further evidence for his proposal, Blench also cites ethnographic evidence such as musical instruments in Borneo shared in common with Austroasiatic-speaking groups in mainland Southeast Asia. Adelaar (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar, K.A. 1995. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.692.6923&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Borneo as a cross-roads for comparative Austronesian linguistics]. In P. Bellwood, J.J. Fox and D. Tryon (eds.), The Austronesians, pp. 81-102. Canberra: Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt; has also noticed phonological and lexical similarities between [[Land Dayak languages|Land Dayak]] and [[Aslian languages|Aslian]].
* '''[[Lepcha language|Lepcha]] substratum''' (&quot;'''''Rongic'''''&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2013. [https://www.academia.edu/5562335/Rongic_a_vanished_branch_of_Austroasiatic ''Rongic: a vanished branch of Austroasiatic'']. m.s.&lt;/ref&gt; Many words of Austroasiatic origin have been noticed in Lepcha, suggesting a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] superstrate laid over an Austroasiatic substrate. Blench (2013) calls this branch &quot;''Rongic''&quot; based on the Lepcha autonym ''Róng''.

Other languages with proposed Austroasiatic substrata are:
* '''[[Jiamao language|Jiamao]]''', based on evidence from the register system of Jiamao, a [[Hlai languages|Hlai]] language (Thurgood 1992).&lt;ref&gt;Thurgood, Graham. 1992. &quot;[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/thurgood1992aberrancy.pdf The aberrancy of the Jiamao dialect of Hlai: speculation on its origins and history]&quot;. In Ratliff, Martha S. and Schiller, E. (eds.), ''Papers from the First Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society'', 417–433. Arizona State University, Program for Southeast Asian Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; Jiamao is known for its highly aberrant vocabulary in relation to other [[Hlai languages]].
* '''[[Kerinci language|Kerinci]]''': van Reijn (1974)&lt;ref&gt;van Reijn, E. O. (1974). &quot;Some Remarks on the Dialects of North Kerintji: A link with Mon-Khmer Languages.&quot; ''Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society'', 31, 2: 130–138. {{JSTOR|41492089}}.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Kerinci, a [[Malayic languages|Malayic]] language of central [[Sumatra]], shares many phonological similarities with Austroasiatic languages, such as [[sesquisyllabic]] word structure and vowel inventory.

John Peterson (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, John (2017). &quot;[http://southasiabibliography.de/uploads/Peterson.pdf The prehistorical spread of Austro-Asiatic in South Asia]&quot;. Presented at ICAAL 7, Kiel, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that &quot;pre-[[Munda languages|Munda]]&quot; languages may have once dominated the eastern [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], and were then absorbed by Indo-Aryan languages at an early date as Indo-Aryan spread east. Peterson notes that eastern [[Indo-Aryan languages]] display many morphosyntactic features similar to those of Munda languages, while western Indo-Aryan languages do not.

== Writing systems ==
Other than Latin-based alphabets, many Austroasiatic languages are written with the [[Khmer alphabet|Khmer]], [[Thai alphabet|Thai]], [[Lao alphabet|Lao]], and [[Burmese alphabet|Burmese]] alphabets. Vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on Chinese logographic writing. This has since been supplanted by the Latin alphabet in the 20th century. The following are examples of past-used alphabets or current alphabets of Austroasiatic languages.

=== Austric languages ===
{{Main|Austric languages}}
Austroasiatic is an integral part of the controversial [[Austric languages|Austric hypothesis]], which also includes the [[Austronesian languages]], and in some proposals also the [[Kra–Dai languages]] and the [[Hmong–Mien languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reid |first1=Lawrence A. |year=2009 |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=Keith |editor2-last=Ogilvie |editor2-first=Sarah |title=Concise Encyclopaedia of Languages of the World |publisher=Elsevier |location=Oxford |pages=92–94 |chapter=Austric Hypothesis |ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hmong-Mien ===
Several lexical resemblances are found between the Hmong-Mien and Austroasiatic language families (Ratliff 2010), some of which had earlier been proposed by [[André-Georges Haudricourt|Haudricourt]] (1951). This could imply a relation or early language contact along the [[Yangtze]].&lt;ref&gt;Haudricourt, André-Georges. 1951. [https://www.persee.fr/doc/befeo_0336-1519_1951_num_44_2_5185 Introduction à la phonologie historique des langues miao-yao] [An introduction to the historical phonology of the Miao-Yao languages]. ''Bulletin de l’École Française d'Extrême-Orient'' 44(2). 555–576.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cai (et al. 2011), [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]] is at least partially related to Austroasiatic but was heavily influenced by [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], especially [[Tibeto-Burman languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Consortium|first=the Genographic|last2=Li|first2=Hui|last3=Jin|first3=Li|last4=Huang|first4=Xingqiu|last5=Li|first5=Shilin|last6=Wang|first6=Chuanchao|last7=Wei|first7=Lanhai|last8=Lu|first8=Yan|last9=Wang|first9=Yi|date=31 August 2011|title=Human Migration through Bottlenecks from Southeast Asia into East Asia during Last Glacial Maximum Revealed by Y Chromosomes|journal=PLOS One|language=en|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e24282|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024282|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3164178|pmid=21904623|bibcode=2011PLoSO...624282C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indo-Aryan languages===
It is suggested that the Austroasiatic languages have some influence on Indo-Aryan languages including [[Sanskrit]] and middle Indo-Aryan languages. Indian linguist [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]] pointed that a specific number of substantives in languages such as [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] were borrowed from [[Munda languages|Munda]] languages. Additionally, French linguist [[Jean Przyluski]] suggested a similarity between the tales from the Austroasiatic realm and the Indian mythological stories of [[Satyavati|Matsyagandha]] (from ''[[Mahabharata]]'') and the [[Nāga]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dx5dzJGGBg0C&amp;pg=PR15&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;dq=austroasiatic+influence+on+india#v=onepage&amp;q=austroasiatic%20influence%20on%20india&amp;f=false|title=Pre-Aryan and Pre-Dravidian in India|last=Lévi|first=Sylvain|last2=Przyluski|first2=Jean|last3=Bloch|first3=Jules|date=1993|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120607729|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Austroasiatic migrations ==
[[:ja:崎谷満|Mitsuru Sakitani]] suggests that [[Haplogroup O-M95|Haplogroup O1b1]], which is common in Austroasiatic people and some other ethnic groups in [[southern China]], and haplogroup O1b2, which is common in today [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Koreans]] and some [[Manchu people|Manchu]], are the carriers of Yangtze civilization ([[Baiyue]]).&lt;ref&gt;崎谷満『DNA・考古・言語の学際研究が示す新・日本列島史』（勉誠出版　2009年）　&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests that the haplogroup O1b1 is the major Austroasiatic paternal lineage and O1b2 the “para-Austroasiatic” lineage of the [[Yayoi people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Z5BDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=japonic+austroasiatic#v=onepage&amp;q=japonic%20austroasiatic&amp;f=false|title=Language Dispersal Beyond Farming|last=Robbeets|first=Martine|last2=Savelyev|first2=Alexander|date=21 December 2017|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027264640|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Migration into India ===
According to Chaubey et al., &quot;Austro-Asiatic speakers in India today are derived from dispersal from [[Southeast Asia]], followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local Indian populations.&quot;{{sfn|Chaubey|Metspalu|Choi|Magi|2010|p=1013}} According to Riccio et al., the Munda people are likely descended from Austroasiatic migrants from Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riccio |first1=M. E. |display-authors=etal |year=2011 |title=The Austroasiatic Munda population from India and Its enigmatic origin: a HLA diversity study |journal=Human Biology |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=405–435 |pmid=21740156 |doi=10.3378/027.083.0306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Language Gulper, [http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Austroasiatic.html ''Austroasiatic Languages'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zhang et al., Austroasiatic migrations from Southeast Asia into India took place after the last Glacial maximum, circa 10,000 years ago.{{sfn|Zhang|2015}} Arunkumar et al. suggest Austroasiatic migrations from Southeast Asia occurred into Northeast India 5.2 ± 0.6 kya and into East India 4.3 ± 0.2 kya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arunkumar | first1 = G.  | display-authors = etal | year = 2015 | title = A late Neolithic expansion of Y chromosomal haplogroup O2a1-M95 from east to west | url = | journal = Journal of Systematics and Evolution | volume = 53 | issue = 6| pages = 546–560 | doi = 10.1111/jse.12147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afroasiatic languages have over 495 million native speakers, the fourth largest number of any language family (after [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/family|title=Summary by language family|website=ethnologue.com|publisher=[[Ethnologue]]|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phylum has six branches: [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Chadic languages|Chadic]], [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Omotic languages|Omotic]] and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]. By far the most widely spoken Afroasiatic language or dialect continuum is [[Arabic]]. A ''[[de facto]]'' group of distinct [[Varieties of Arabic|language varieties]] within the Semitic branch, the languages that evolved from [[Proto-Arabic]] have around 313 million native speakers, concentrated primarily in West Asia and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ara|title=Arabic|website=ethnologue.com|publisher=[[Ethnologue]]|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to languages spoken today, Afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages, such as [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]], which forms a distinct branch of the family, and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Biblical Hebrew]] and [[Old Aramaic language|Old Aramaic]], all of which are from the Semitic branch. The [[Afroasiatic Urheimat|original homeland]] of the Afroasiatic family, and when the parent language (i.e. [[Proto-Afroasiatic]]) was spoken, are yet to be agreed upon by [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]]. Proposed locations include the [[Horn of Africa]], [[North Africa]], the Eastern [[Sahara]] and the [[Levant]].

==Etymology==
In the early 19th century, linguists grouped the [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] and [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] languages within a &quot;Hamitic&quot; phylum, in acknowledgement of these languages' [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relation]] with each other and with those in the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] phylum.{{Failed verification|reason=The linked page does not mention &quot;phylum&quot; or anything mentioned in this sentence; it is however, a link to the book it cites.|date=February 2019}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlen&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merritt|first1=Ruhlen|title=A Guide to the World's Languages: Classification|date=1991|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0804718943|pages=76 &amp; 87|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=mYwmDE3f6wUC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms &quot;Hamitic&quot; and &quot;Semitic&quot; were etymologically derived from the [[Book of Genesis]], which describes various Biblical tribes descended from [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] and [[Shem]], two sons of [[Noah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregersen|first1=Edgar A.|title=Language in Africa: An Introductory Survey|date=1977|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0677043807|page=[https://archive.org/details/languageinafrica0000greg/page/116 116]|url=https://archive.org/details/languageinafrica0000greg/page/116|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s, the main constituent elements within the broader Afroasiatic family had been worked out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlen&quot;/&gt;

[[Friedrich Müller (linguist)|Friedrich Müller]] introduced the name &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; for the entire language family in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft'' (1876).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipiński&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipiński|first=Edward|title=Semitic Languages: Outline of a Comparative Grammar|year=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-0815-4|pages=21–22|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=IiXVqyEkPKcC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Delafosse]] (1914) later coined the term &quot;Afroasiatic&quot; (often now spelled &quot;Afro-Asiatic&quot;). However, it did not come into general use until [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1950) formally proposed its adoption. In doing so, Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that 'Hamitic' was not a valid group and that language [[cladistics]] did not reflect race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dimm&quot;&gt;[[Gerrit Dimmendaal]] (2008) 'Language Ecology and Linguistic Diversity on the African Continent', ''Language and Linguistics Compass''&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual scholars have also called the family &quot;Erythraean&quot; (Tucker 1966) and &quot;Lisramic&quot; (Hodge 1972). In lieu of &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot;, the Russian linguist [[Igor Diakonoff]] later suggested the term &quot;Afrasian&quot;, meaning &quot;half African, half Asiatic&quot;, in reference to the geographic distribution of the family's constituent languages.&lt;ref name=NEB&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Volume 8; Volume 22|year=1998|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=978-0-85229-633-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia03ency/page/722 722]|url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia03ency/page/722|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countries, as well as in the official census of the government of India.

==Distribution and branches==
[[File:Interrelations between branches of Afro-Asiatic.svg|thumb|300px|Interrelations between branches of Afroasiatic (Lipiński 2001)]]
[[File:afroasiatic.svg|thumb|right|300px|Some linguists' proposals for grouping within Afroasiatic]]
Scholars generally treat the Afroasiatic language family as including the following branches:
* [[Berber languages|Berber]]
* [[Chadic languages|Chadic]]
* [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]
* [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]
* [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]
* [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]

Although there is general agreement on these six families, [[linguistics|linguists]] who study Afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement, in particular:
* The [[Omotic]] language branch is the most controversial member of Afroasiatic, because the grammatical formatives to which most linguists have given the greatest weight in classifying languages in the family &quot;are either absent or distinctly wobbly&quot; (Hayward 1995). Greenberg (1963) and others considered it a subgroup of Cushitic, whereas others have raised doubts about its being part of Afroasiatic at all (e.g. Theil 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sands2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1749-818x.2008.00124.x|title = Africa's Linguistic Diversity| journal=Language and Linguistics Compass| volume=3| issue=2| pages=559–580|year = 2009|last1 = Sands|first1 = Bonny}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Afroasiatic identity of [[Ongota language|Ongota]] is also broadly questioned, as is its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it, due to the &quot;mixed&quot; appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data. [[Harold C. Fleming |Harold Fleming]] (2006) proposes that Ongota constitutes a separate branch of Afroasiatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/pcgi/a.cgi?ausgabe=index&amp;T=1235007315045{haupt_harrassowitz=http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/title_3277.ahtml?T=1235007315045}|title= Harrassowitz Verlag – The Harrassowitz Publishing House&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website= harrassowitz-verlag.de|accessdate= 14 April 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170629231821/https://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/pcgi/a.cgi?ausgabe=index&amp;T=1235007315045%7Bhaupt_harrassowitz%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.harrassowitz-verlag.de%2Ftitle_3277.ahtml%3FT%3D1235007315045%7D|archive-date= 29 June 2017|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonny Sands (2009) finds the proposal by Savà and Tosco (2003) the most convincing: namely that Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a [[Nilo-Saharan languages |Nilo-Saharan]] [[substratum]]. In other words, it would appear that the Ongota people once spoke a Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language but retained some characteristics of their earlier Nilo-Saharan language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sands2009&quot; /&gt;
* [[Beja language|Beja]], sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic, is more often included in the Cushitic branch, which has a substantial degree of internal diversity.
* There is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five non-Omotic branches of Afroasiatic (see [[#Subgrouping|§ Subgrouping]] below). This situation is not unusual, even among long-established language families: scholars also frequently disagree on the internal classification of the [[Indo-European languages]], for instance.
* The extinct [[Meroitic language]] has been proposed ([[Bruce Trigger]], 1964,&lt;ref name=Trigger01&gt;Trigger, Bruce G., ''‘Meroitic and Eastern Sudanic: A Linguistic Relationship?’'', Kush 12, 1964, 188–194.&lt;/ref&gt; 1977&lt;ref name=Trigger02&gt;Trigger, Bruce, G.,''‘The Classification of Meroitic: Geographical Considerations’'', Schriften zur Geschichte und Kultur des Alten Orients 13, 1977, 421–435.&lt;/ref&gt;) as an unclassified Afroasiatic language, because it shares the [[phonotactics]] characteristic of the family, but there is not enough evidence to secure a classification (Fritz Hintze, 1974,&lt;ref name=Hintze01&gt;Hintze, Fritz, ''‘Some Problems of Meroitic Philology’'', Abdel Gadir Mahmoud Abdalla (ed.),  Studies of the Ancient Languages of the Sudan, Sudanese Studies 3, Khartoum University Press, Khartoum, 1974, 73–78.&lt;/ref&gt; 1979&lt;ref name=Hintze02&gt;Hintze, Fritz ''‘Beiträge zur meroitische Grammatik.’'' Meroitica 3, Berlin, 1979, 1–214.&lt;/ref&gt;).
* The classification of [[Kujargé language|Kujargé]] within Afroasiatic is not agreed upon. Blench (2008) notes that much of the basic vocabulary looks [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]], and speculates that Kujarge could even be a conservative language transitional between Chadic and Cushitic.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench, 2008. 'Links between Cushitic, Omotic, Chadic and the position of Kujarge'.

==Classification history==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Berber people]] --&gt;
In the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian [[Judah ibn Kuraish|Judah ibn Quraysh]] of [[Tiaret]] in [[Algeria]] was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic. He knew of Semitic through his study of Arabic, Hebrew, and [[Aramaic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipiński&quot; /&gt; In the course of the 19th century, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships. In 1844, [[Theodor Benfey]] suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter &quot;Ethiopic&quot;).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In the same year, T.N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Friedrich Müller (linguist)|Friedrich Müller]] named the traditional Hamito-Semitic family in 1876 in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft'' (&quot;Outline of Linguistics&quot;), and defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a &quot;Hamitic&quot; group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} It was the [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] (1810–1884) who restricted Hamitic to the non-Semitic languages in Africa, which are characterized by a grammatical [[Grammatical gender|gender system]]. This &quot;Hamitic language group&quot; was proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including the Ancient [[Egyptian language]], the [[Berber languages]], the [[Cushitic languages]], the [[Beja language]], and the [[Chadic languages]]. Unlike Müller, Lepsius considered that [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Nama language|Nama]] were part of the Hamitic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. Both authors used the skin-color, mode of subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together.&lt;ref name = &quot;mer&quot;&gt;[[Merritt Ruhlen]], ''A Guide to the World's Languages: Classification'', Stanford University Press, 1991, pp. 80–1&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Africa ethnic groups 1996.png|thumb|Distribution of the Afroasiatic/Hamito-Semitic languages in Africa]]
In 1912, [[Carl Meinhof]] published ''Die Sprachen der Hamiten'' (&quot;The Languages of the Hamites&quot;), in which he expanded Lepsius's model, adding the [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Maasai language|Maasai]], [[Bari language|Bari]], [[Nandi languages|Nandi]], [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] languages to the Hamitic group. Meinhof's model was widely supported into the 1940s.&lt;ref name = &quot;mer&quot;/&gt; Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that &quot;speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'', CRC Press, 2005, p.797&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of the so-called [[Nilo-Hamitic languages]] (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a &quot;fallacious theory of [[mixed language|language mixture]].&quot; Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub &quot;Nilo-Hamitic&quot; were in fact Nilotic languages, with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlen109&quot;&gt;Merritt Ruhlen, ''A Guide to the World's Languages'', (Stanford University Press: 1991), p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leo Reinisch]] (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic. However, his suggestion found little acceptance. [[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct &quot;Hamitic&quot; subgroup, and included [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary. Finally, [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of &quot;Hamitic&quot; as a language category by linguists. Greenberg refuted Meinhof's linguistic theories, and rejected the use of racial and social evidence. In dismissing the notion of a separate &quot;Nilo-Hamitic&quot; language category in particular, Greenberg was &quot;returning to a view widely held a half century earlier.&quot; He consequently rejoined Meinhof's so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlen&quot;/&gt; He also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family. Almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus.

Greenberg's model was fully developed in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably [[Nilo-Saharan]]. Following [[Isaac Schapera]] and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the [[Hottentot language|Khoekhoe language]] as a member of the [[Khoisan languages]], a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of [[Click consonant|click sounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sands|first=Bonnie|date=2009|title=Africa's linguistic diversity|url=|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|volume=3|issue=2|pages=559–580|doi=10.1111/j.1749-818X.2008.00124.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], though this view has been discredited as linguists working on these languages consider them to be [[Language isolate|linguistic isolates]].&lt;ref&gt;Sands, Bonny E. (1998) 'Eastern and Southern African Khoisan: evaluating claims of distant linguistic relationships.' Quellen zur Khoisan-Forschung 14. Köln: Köppe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlen, p.117&quot;&gt;Ruhlen, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Greenberg's classification remains a starting point for modern work of many languages spoken in Africa, and the Hamitic category (and its extension to Nilo-Hamitic) has no part in this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlen, p.117&quot;/&gt;

Since the three traditional branches of the Hamitic languages (Berber, Cushitic and Egyptian) have not been shown to form an exclusive ([[Monophyly|monophyletic]]) phylogenetic unit of their own, separate from other Afroasiatic languages, linguists no longer use the term in this sense. Each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger Afroasiatic family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welmers&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Everett Welmers|first1=William|title=African Language Structures|date=1974|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520022102|page=[https://archive.org/details/africanlanguages0000welm/page/16 16]|url=https://archive.org/details/africanlanguages0000welm/page/16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]] proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic, suggesting for it the new name [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]. This proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance.

Based on typological differences with the other Cushitic languages, [[Robert Hetzron]] proposed that Beja has to be removed from Cushitic, thus forming an independent branch of Afroasiatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hetzron|first1=Robert|title=The limits of Cushitic|journal=Sprache und Geschichte in Afrika|date=1980|volume=2|page=7–126 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars, however, reject this proposal, and continue to group Beja as the sole member of a Northern branch within Cushitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appleyard|first1=David|editor1-last=Edzard|editor1-first=Lutz|title=Semitic and Afroasiatic: Challenges and Opportunities|year=2012|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783447066952|chapter=Cushitic |pages=199–295 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Güldemann |first=Tom |year=2018 |chapter=Historical linguistics and genealogical language classification in Africa |editor-last=Güldemann |editor-first=Tom |title=The Languages and Linguistics of Africa |pages=58–444 |series=The World of Linguistics, Volume 11 |place=Berlin |publisher=De Mouton Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Glottolog]]'' does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of Omotic has been established, nor that of Ongota or the unclassified Kujarge. It therefore splits off the following groups as small families: [[South Omotic languages|South Omotic]], [[Mao languages|Mao]], [[Dizoid languages|Dizoid]], [[Gonga–Gimojan languages|Gonga–Gimojan]] (North Omotic apart from the preceding), [[Ongota language|Ongota]], [[Kujarge language|Kujarge]].

Little agreement exists on the [[subgrouping (linguistics)|subgrouping]] of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic: Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic. However, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first.

Otherwise:
* [[Paul Newman (linguist)|Paul Newman]] (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic in Afroasiatic. Rolf Theil (2006) concurs with the exclusion of Omotic, but does not otherwise address the structure of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/iln/LING2110/v07/THEIL%20Is%20Omotic%20Afroasiatic.pdf|title=Is Omotic Afroasiatic? (In Norwegian)|author=|date=|website=uio.no|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Harold Fleming (1981) divides non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or &quot;Erythraean&quot;, into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian. He later added Semitic and Beja to Chadic-Berber-Egyptian and tentatively proposed [[Ongota language|Ongota]] as a new third branch of Erythraean. He thus divided Afroasiatic into two major branches, Omotic and Erythraean, with Erythraean consisting of three sub-branches, Cushitic, Chadic-Berber-Egyptian-Semitic-Beja, and Ongota.
* Like Harold Fleming, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1995: 490) divides Afroasiatic into two branches, Omotic and Erythrean. He divides Omotic into two branches, North Omotic and South Omotic. He divides Erythrean into Cushitic, comprising Beja, Agaw, and East-South Cushitic, and North Erythrean, comprising Chadic and &quot;Boreafrasian.&quot; According to his classification, Boreafrasian consists of Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic.
* [[Vladimir Orel]] and Olga Stolbova (1995) group Berber with Semitic and Chadic with Egyptian. They split up Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afroasiatic, viewing Cushitic as a [[Sprachbund]] rather than a [[language family]].
* [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1996) subdivides Afroasiatic in two, grouping Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as East-West Afrasian (ESA), and Chadic with Egyptian as North-South Afrasian (NSA). He excludes Omotic from Afroasiatic.
* [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] (1997) groups Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as &quot;Macro-Cushitic&quot;. He regards Chadic and Omotic as the branches of Afroasiatic most remote from the others.
* Alexander Militarev (2000), on the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], groups Berber with Chadic and both more distantly with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic. He places Ongota in South Omotic.

==Position among the world's languages==
Afroasiatic is one of the four major [[Languages of Africa|language families]] spoken in Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963). It is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental, with languages from Afroasiatic's Semitic branch also spoken in the Middle East and Europe.

There are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family. However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known of these are the following:
* [[Hermann Möller]] (1906) argued for a relation between [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and the [[Indo-European languages]]. This proposal was accepted by a few linguists (e.g. [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]]). (For a fuller account, see [[Indo-Semitic languages]].) However, the theory has little currency today, although most linguists do not deny the existence of grammatical similarities between both families (such as [[grammatical gender]], noun-adjective [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], three-way [[Grammatical number|number]] distinction, and [[vowel alternation]] as a means of derivation).
* Apparently influenced by Möller (a colleague of his at the [[University of Copenhagen]]), [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] included Hamito-Semitic (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic macro-family]] (cf. Pedersen 1931:336–338), also included the Indo-European, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], [[Yukaghir languages]], and [[Dravidian languages]]. This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists, starting with [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]].
* [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000–2002) did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he called [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], and to which he added [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotian]], [[Nivkh language|Gilyak]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japonic languages|Japanese-Ryukyuan]], [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]], and [[Ainu languages|Ainu]].
* Most recently, [[Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin|Sergei Starostin]]'s school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic. The even larger [[Borean languages|Borean super-family]] contains Nostratic as well as [[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené-Caucasian]] and [[Austric languages|Austric]].

==Date of Afroasiatic==
[[File:Assyriansample.ogg|thumb|right|180px|Speech sample in the Semitic [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Neo-Aramaic]] language, a descendant of [[Old Aramaic]]]]
The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] inscription dated to c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/9903/newsbriefs/egypt.html|title=Earliest Egyptian Glyphs – Archaeology Magazine Archive|author=|date=|website=www.archaeology.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols on [[Gerzeh culture|Gerzean]] (Naqada II) pottery resembling [[Egyptian hieroglyphs#History and evolution|Egyptian hieroglyphs]] date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating. This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic. However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from [[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afroasiatic]] (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely. They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken [[circa|c.]] 10,000 BC. Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC. These dates are older than those associated with other [[proto-language]]s.

==Afroasiatic Urheimat==
{{main|Afroasiatic Urheimat}}
[[File:Expansion of Afroasiatic.svg|thumb|upright|Map showing one of the proposed Afroasiatic Urheimat (Eastern Sahara theory.)]]
The term Afroasiatic Urheimat (''Urheimat'' meaning &quot;original homeland&quot; in German) refers to the hypothetical place where [[Proto-Afroasiatic language]] speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages. Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in [[Western Asia|West Asia]], [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and parts of the [[Sahel]]. Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the [[Sahara pump theory|Sahara pump]] operating over the last 10,000 years.

There is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed. The main theories of Urheimat are the Levant/Fertile Crescent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wKT-5SOAKQC&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Quantitative Approaches to Linguistic Diversity: Commemorating the Centenary of the Birth of Morris Swadesh|page=73|isbn=978-9027202659|last1=Wichmann|first1=Søren|last2=Grant|first2=Anthony|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyhvaJq2biEC&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Transition to Modernity: Essays on Power, Wealth and Belief|author=John A.

Widespread (though not universal) features of the Afroasiatic languages include:
* A set of [[emphatic consonant]]s, variously realized as glottalized, pharyngealized, or implosive.
* [[Verb–subject–object|VSO]] [[linguistic typology|typology]] with [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] tendencies.
* A two-[[grammatical gender|gender]] system in the singular, with the feminine marked by the sound /t/.
* All Afroasiatic subfamilies show evidence of a [[causative]] affix ''s''.
* Semitic, Berber, Cushitic (including Beja), and Chadic support [[possessive suffix]]es.
* [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|Nisba]] derivation in ''-j'' (earlier Egyptian) or ''-ī'' (Semitic)&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Peust,  [http://www.peust.de/2012_afroasiatic.pdf &quot;On the subgrouping of Afroasiatic&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909220832/http://www.peust.de/2012_afroasiatic.pdf |date=9 September 2016 }}, ''LingAeg'' 20 (2012), 221–251 (p. 243).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] in which words inflect by changes within the root (vowel changes or [[gemination]]) as well as with prefixes and suffixes.

One of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation (see the table at the start of this section), with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with /ʔ t n y/, and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine /y-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/.

According to Ehret (1996), [[tonal language]]s appear in the Omotic and Chadic branches of Afroasiatic, as well as in certain Cushitic languages. The Semitic, Berber and Egyptian branches generally do not use tones [[phoneme|phonemically]].

==Etymology==
The origin of the word Andorra is unknown, although several hypotheses have been formulated. The oldest derivation of the word Andorra is from the Greek historian [[Polybius]] (''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'' III, 35, 1) who describes the Andosins, an [[Iberians|Iberian]] [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|Pre-Roman tribe]], as historically located in the valleys of Andorra and facing the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] army in its passage through the Pyrenees during the [[Punic Wars]]. The word Andosini or Andosins (Ἀνδοσίνοι) may derive from the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''handia'' whose meaning is &quot;big&quot; or &quot;giant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diccionari&quot;&gt;''Diccionari d'Història de Catalunya''; ed. 62; Barcelona; 1998; {{ISBN|84-297-3521-6}}; p. 42; entrada &quot;Andorra&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Andorran [[toponymy]] shows evidence of Basque language in the area. Another theory suggests that the word Andorra may derive from the old word Anorra that contains the Basque word ''ur'' (water).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Font Rius |first=José María |title=Estudis sobre els drets i institucions locals en la Catalunya medieval |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQL6rtB8VtQC&amp;pg=PA743&amp;dq=Anorra+andorra#v=onepage&amp;q=Anorra%20andorra |publisher=Edicions Universitat Barcelona |year=1985 |page=743 |isbn=978-8475281742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory suggests that Andorra may derive from [[Arabic]] ''al-darra'' (الدرة), meaning &quot;the thickly wooded place&quot;. When the [[Arabs]] and [[Moors]] conquered the Iberian Peninsula, the valleys of the High Pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest, and most of the regions that were not administered by Muslims, because of the geographical difficulty that was presented, received this designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaston|first=L.

Other theories suggest that the term derives from the [[Navarro-Aragonese]] andurrial, which means &quot;land covered with bushes&quot; or &quot;scrubland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Andorra |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[folk etymology]] holds that [[Charlemagne]] had named the region as a reference to the Biblical [[Canaan]]ite valley of [[Endor (village)|Endor]] or [[Endor (village)|Andor]] (where the [[Midianites]] had been defeated), a name bestowed by his heir and son [[Louis le Debonnaire]] after defeating the Moors in the &quot;wild valleys of Hell&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Images of the Medieval Peasant|page=189|last=Freedman|first=Paul|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=CA, USA|year=1999|isbn=9780804733731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Gravats_del_Roc_de_les_Bruixes.JPG|left|thumb|Roc de les Bruixes prehistorical sanctuary in [[Canillo]] (detail)]]

La Balma de la [[La Margineda|Margineda]], found by archaeologists at [[Sant Julià de Lòria]], was settled in 9,500 BC as a passing place between the two sides of the Pyrenees. The seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of hunter-gatherers from [[Ariège (river)|Ariege]] and [[Segre (river)|Segre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elcami.cat/principat-andorra/andorra/andorra-vella/margineda|title=La Margineda - El Camí|date=21 April 2014|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015125705/http://elcami.cat/principat-andorra/andorra/andorra-vella/margineda|archivedate=15 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Neolithic Age]], a group of people moved to the [[Madriu-Perafita-Claror Valley|Valley of Madriu]] (nowadays Natural Parc located in [[Escaldes-Engordany]] declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) as a permanent camp in 6640 BC. The population of the valley grew cereals, raised domestic livestock, and developed a commercial trade with people from the [[Sègre (department)|Segre]] and [[Occitania]].{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 32, 33}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}}

Other archaeological deposits include the Tombs of [[Segudet]] ([[Ordino]]) and Feixa del Moro (Sant Julia de Loria) both dated in 4900–4300 BC as an example of the [[Urnfield culture|Urn culture]] in Andorra.{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 32, 33}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}} The model of small settlements began to evolve to a complex urbanism during the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Metallurgy|Metallurgical]] items of iron, ancient coins, and relicaries can be found in the [[Sanctuary|ancient sanctuaries]] scattered around the country.

The sanctuary of Roc de les Bruixes (Stone of the Witches) is perhaps the most important archeological complex of this age in Andorra, located in the parish of [[Canillo]], about the rituals of funerals, ancient scripture and engraved stone [[mural]]s.{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 34, 35, 38, 39}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}}

===The Iberian and Roman Andorra===
[[File:Ann%C3%ADbal,_andosins.png|left|thumb|[[Hannibal]]'s route (red) during the [[Second Punic War]]. The Iberian tribes (green) fought against the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] army in the Pyrenees.]]

The inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the [[Iberians]] and historically located in Andorra as the Iberian tribe Andosins or Andosini (Ἀνδοσίνους) during the 7th and 2nd centuries BC. Influenced by [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanias]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Iberian languages]], the locals developed some current toponyms. Early writings and documents relating to this group of people goes back to the second century BC by the Greek writer [[Polybius]] in his ''Histories'' during the [[Punic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www15.gencat.net/pres_casa_llengues/mapes/mapes.html?idioma=1&amp;start=cercador|title=Mapes Vius - Linguamon.

Some of the most significant remains of this era are the Castle of the Roc d'Enclar (part of the early [[Marca Hispanica]]),{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 44, 45, 46, 47}} l'Anxiu in [[Les Escaldes]] and Roc de L'Oral in [[Encamp]].{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 36, 37}}

The presence of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] influence is recorded from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD. The places found with more Roman presence are in Camp Vermell (Red Field) in Sant Julia de Loria, and in some places in Encamp, as well as in the Roc d'Enclar. People continued trading, mainly with wine and cereals, with the Roman cities of [[Urgellet]] (nowaday [[La Seu d'Urgell]]) and all across Segre through the [[Roman roads|Via Romana]] Strata Ceretana (also known as Strata Confluetana).{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 52, 53}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 44, 45, 46, 47}}

===The Visigoths and Carolingians: the legend of Charlemagne===
[[File:Charlemagne_et_Louis_le_Pieux.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charlemagne]] instructing his son, [[Louis the Pious]]]]

After the [[fall of the Roman Empire]], Andorra came under the influence of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigoths]], not remotely from the [[History of Toledo, Spain#Visigothic Toledo|Kingdom of Toledo]], but locally from the [[Diocese of Urgell]]. The Visigoths remained in the valleys for 200 years, during which time [[Gothic Christianity|Christianity]] spread. When the [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Empire]] and its [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquest]] of most of the Iberian Peninsula replaced the ruling Visigoths, Andorra was sheltered from these invaders by the [[Francia|Franks]].{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

Tradition holds that Charles the Great (Charlemagne) granted a charter to the Andorran people for a contingent of five thousand soldiers under the command of Marc Almugaver, in return for fighting against the [[Moors]] near [[Porté-Puymorens]] ([[Cerdanya]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turisme.andorralavella.ad/llegendes-tradicionals/pas-carlemany|title=El pas de Carlemany - Turisme Andorra la Vella|website=turisme.andorralavella.ad|accessdate=3 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803170725/http://turisme.andorralavella.ad/llegendes-tradicionals/pas-carlemany|archive-date=3 August 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra remained part of the Marca Hispanica of the [[Frankish Empire]] being part of the territory ruled by the [[Count of Urgell]] and eventually by the [[Bishop of Urgel|bishop]] of the Diocese of Urgell. Also tradition holds that it was guaranteed by the son of Charlemagne, [[Louis the Pious]], writing the ''Carta de Poblament'' or a local [[municipal charter]] circa 805.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/article/19-cultura/933027-andorra-mira-els-arxius.html|title=Andorra mira els arxius|first=Jaume|last=Vidal|website=Elpuntavui.cat|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 988, [[Borrell II]], Count of Urgell, gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya.&lt;ref name=&quot;histo1&quot;&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=La formació d'Andorra|NDCHEC=0003864|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Bishop of Urgell, based in Seu d'Urgell, has been [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-prince]] of Andorra.&lt;ref name=elements&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |title=Elements de la història del Principat d'Andorra |language=Catalan |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20100209181327/http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |archivedate= 9 February 2010 |url-status = dead|df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first document that mentions Andorra as a territory is the ''Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d'Urgell'' (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d'Urgell). The old document dated from 839 depicts the six old [[Parishes of Andorra|parishes]] of the Andorran valleys and therefore the administrative division of the country.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}

===Medieval Age: The Paréages and the founding of the Co-Principality===
[[File:Esgl%C3%A9sia_de_Sant_Joan_de_Caselles_-_7.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sant Joan de Caselles]] church, dating from the 11th century, part of the Andorran Romanesque heritage]]
Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection and the Bishop of Urgell, who knew that the count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys,&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; asked the [[lord of Caboet]] for help and protection. In 1095, the Lord of Caboet and the bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the viscount of Castellbò. Their daughter, Ermessenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=Ermessenda de Castellbò|NDCHEC=0024413|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; married the [[count of Foix]], [[Roger-Bernard II, Count of Foix|Roger-Bernard II]]. Roger-Bernard II and Ermessenda shared ruled over Andorra with the bishop of Urgell.

In the 13th century, a military dispute arose between the bishop of Urgell and the count of Foix as aftermath of the [[Cathar Crusade]]. The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of the [[king of Aragon]], [[Peter II of Aragon|Peter II]], between the bishop and the count, by the signing of the [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|first paréage]] which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the bishop of Urgell, in [[Catalonia]]. This gave the principality its territory and political form.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009}}

A second paréage was signed in 1288 after a dispute when the count of Foix ordered the construction of a castle in Roc d'Enclar.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009}} The document was ratified by the noble notary [[County of Cerdanya|Jaume Orig of Puigcerdà]] and the construction of military structures in the country was prohibited.{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 60, 61}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}

In 1364 the political organization of the country named the figure of the [[syndic]] (now spokesman and president of the parliament) as representative of the Andorrans to their co-princes making possible the creation of [[Parishes of Andorra|local departments]] (comuns, quarts and veïnats). After being ratified by Bishop Francesc Tovia and Count [[John I, Count of Foix|John I]], the Consell de la Terra or [[General Council (Andorra)|Consell General de les Valls]] (General Council of the Valleys) was founded in 1419, the second oldest parliament in Europe. The syndic Andreu d'Alàs and the General Council organized the creation of the [[Politics of Andorra#Judicial branch|Justice Courts]] (La Cort de Justicia) in 1433 with the co-Princes and the collection of taxes like foc i lloc (literally fire and site, a national tax active since then).{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 78, 79, 80, 81, 88, 89}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

Although there are remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century (Sant Vicenç d'Enclar or [[Església de Santa Coloma]]), Andorra developed exquisite [[Romanesque Art and Architecture|Romanesque Art]] during the 9th through 14th centuries, particularly in the construction of churches, bridges, religious murals and statues of the [[Virgin and Child]] ([[Our Lady of Meritxell]] being the most important).{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}} Nowadays, the [[List of regional characteristics of Romanesque churches#Romanesque churches in Spain, Portugal and Andorra|Romanesque]] buildings that form part of [[Cultural Heritage of Andorra|Andorra's cultural heritage]] stand out in a remarkable way, with an emphasis on [[Església de Sant Esteve]], [[Sant Joan de Caselles]], [[Església de Sant Miquel d'Engolasters]], [[Sant Martí de la Cortinada]] and the medieval bridges of [[Pont de la Margineda|Margineda]] and [[Pont dels Escalls|Escalls]] among many others.{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 48, 49}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 150 a 194}}

While the Catalan Pyrenees were embryonic of the [[Catalan language]] at the end of the 11th century Andorra was influenced by the appearance of that language where it was adopted by proximity and influence even decades before it was expanded by the rest of the Crown of Aragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webs.racocatala.cat/cat1714/d/histcat.pdf|title=HISTÒRIA DE LA LLENGUA CATALANA|website=Racocatala.cat|accessdate=2017-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035808/http://webs.racocatala.cat/cat1714/d/histcat.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local population based its economy during the Middle Ages in livestock and agriculture, as well as in furs and weavers. Later, at the end of the 11th century, the first [[Bloomery#Medieval Europe|iron foundries]] began to appear in Northern Parishes like [[Ordino]], much appreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges, an important economic activity in the country from the 15th century.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

In 1601 the [[Andorra#Law and criminal justice|Tribunal de Corts]] (High Court of Justice) was created as a result of [[Huguenot rebellions]] from France, [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] courts coming from Spain and [[Catalan mythology about witches|indigenous witchcraft]] experienced in the country due to the [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]].{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|pp=44, 45, 47, 48, 50}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 108, 109}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 238, 239}} With the passage of time, the co-title to Andorra passed to the kings of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. After [[Henry III of Navarre]] became [[king of France]], he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the French state and the bishop of Urgell as [[co-princes of Andorra]]. During 1617, communal councils form the sometent (popular militia or army) to deal with the rise of bandolerisme ([[brigandage]]) and the Consell de la Terra was defined and structured in terms of its composition, organization and competences current today.{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|pp=44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 53, 54, 56}}

Andorra continued with the same economic system that it had during the 12th–14th centuries with a large production of metallurgy (fargues, a system similar to Farga catalana) and with the introduction of tobacco circa 1692 and import trade. The fair of Andorra la Vella was ratified by the co-princes in 1371 and 1448 being the most important annual national festival commercially ever since.{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=14}}{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=15}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 134}}

The country had a unique and experienced [[guild]] of weavers, Confraria de Paraires i Teixidors, located in [[Escaldes-Engordany]] founded in 1604 taking advantage of the thermal waters of the area. By this time, the country was characterized by the social system of prohoms (wealthy society) and casalers (rest of the population with smaller economic acquisition), deriving from the tradition of [[pubilla]] and [[Heir|hereu]].{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|pp=20, 21}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp=106, 107}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 105, 106, 107, 140, 141}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 263 a 270}}

Three centuries after its foundation the Consell de la Terra located its headquarters and the Tribunal de Corts in [[Casa de la Vall]] in 1702. The [[manor house]] built in 1580 served as a noble fortress of the Busquets family. Inside the parliament was placed the Closet of the six keys (Armari de les sis claus) representative of each Andorran parish and where the [[Andorran constitution]] and other documents and laws were kept later on.{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=60}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 82}}

In both the [[Reapers' War]] and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the Andorran people (although professing to be a neutral country) supported the [[Catalans]] who saw their [[Catalan constitutions|rights]] reduced in [[Nueva Planta decrees|1716]]. The reaction was the promotion of Catalan writings in Andorra, with cultural works such as the ''Book of Privileges'' (''Llibre de Privilegis de 1674''), ''Manual Digest'' (1748) by Antoni Fiter i Rossell or the ''Polità andorrà'' (1763) by Antoni Puig.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 229}}{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|pp = 49 a 52, i 57, 58}}

===19th century: the New Reform and the Andorran Question===
[[File:Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit (cropped).png|thumb|upright|left|[[Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit]] led the New Reform of 1866.]]
After the French Revolution in 1809, Napoleon I reestablished the Co-Principate and removed the French medieval title. In 1812–1813, the [[First French Empire]] annexed Catalonia during the [[Peninsular War]] ({{lang|ca|Guerra Peninsular}}) and divided the region into four [[département]]s, with Andorra as a part of the district of [[Puigcerdà]]. In 1814, an imperial decree reestablished the independence and economy of Andorra.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p=172}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p=172}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=342–343}}

During this period, Andorra's late medieval institutions and rural culture remained largely unchanged. In 1866, the [[syndic]] [[Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit]] led the reformist group in a Council General of 24 members elected by suffrage limited to heads of families. The Council General replaced the aristocratic oligarchy that previously ruled the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Page 966, Volume 1, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Eleventh Edition, 1910–1911&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Reform ({{lang|ca|Nova Reforma}}) began after ratification by both Co-Princes and established the basis of the [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.elperiodic.ad/opinio/article/49262/150-anys-de-la-nova-reforma|title = Antoni Pol – 150 anys de la (nova) Reforma|language = ca|access-date = 2 February 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190506122112/https://www.elperiodic.ad/opinio/article/49262/150-anys-de-la-nova-reforma|archive-date = 6 May 2019|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and symbols—such as the [[Flag of Andorra|tricolor flag]]—of Andorra.

The authorities of the Co-Princes banned casinos and betting houses throughout the country. The ban resulted in an economic conflict for the Andorran people. The conflict led to the so-called revolution of 1881, when revolutionaries assaulted the house of the syndic on 8 December 1880, and established the Provisional Revolutionary Council led by Joan Pla i Calvo and Pere Baró i Mas. The Provisional Revolutionary Council allowed for the construction of casinos and spas by foreign companies.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=198–203}}

From 7 to 9 June 1881, the loyalists of [[Canillo]] and [[Encamp]] reconquered the parishes of [[Ordino]] and [[La Massana]] by establishing contact with the revolutionary forces in [[Escaldes-Engordany]].{{sfn|Peruga Guerrero|1998|pp=59–63}} After a day of combat the [[Pont dels Escalls|Treaty of the Bridge of Escalls]] was signed on 10 June.{{sfn|Ministeri d'Educació, Joventut i Esports|1996|pp=58–65}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=194–195}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=348–350}} The Council was replaced and new elections were held.

Andorra participated in the cultural movement of the Catalan [[Renaixença]]. Between 1882 and 1887, the first academic schools were formed where trilingualism coexisted with the official language, Catalan. [[Romanticism|Romantic]] authors from France and Spain reported the awakening of the [[Romantic nationalism|national consciousness]] of the country. [[Jacint Verdaguer]] lived in Ordino during the 1880s where he wrote and shared works related to the Renaixença with writer and photographer, [[Casa Rossell|Joaquim de Riba]].

In 1848, [[Fromental Halévy]] had premiered the opera ''[[Le val d'Andorre|Le Val d'Andorre]]'' to great success in Europe, where the national consciousness of the valleys was exposed in the romantic work during the Peninsular War.{{sfn|Peruga Guerrero|1998|pp=78–81}}{{sfn|Ministeri d'Educació, Joventut i Esports|1996|p=74}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=354–357}}

In 1933, France occupied Andorra following social unrest which occurred before elections due to the Revolution of 1933 and the FHASA strikes (Vagues de FHASA); the revolt led by Joves Andorrans (a [[Trade union|labour union group]] related to the Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]]) called for political reforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international-club-andorra.com/andorra-club-intercomm/historical-andorra-articles/rebellion-in-andorra-1933/|title=Rebellion in Andorra 1933 – International Club of Andorra|website=International-club-andorra.com|access-date=29 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506122103/https://www.international-club-andorra.com/andorra-club-intercomm/historical-andorra-articles/rebellion-in-andorra-1933/|archive-date=6 May 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[universal suffrage|universal suffrage vote]] of all Andorrans and acted in defense of the rights of local and foreign workers during the construction of FHASA's hydroelectric power station in [[Encamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bondia.ad/cultura/1933-la-republica-que-quasi-va-ser|title=1933: la República que quasi va ser}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5 April 1933 Joves Andorrans seized the Andorran Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/spain/la-vanguardia-1%C2%AA-edici%C3%B3n/20170604/282071981866496|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=Pressreader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These actions were preceded by the arrival of Colonel René-Jules Baulard with 50 [[National Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] and the mobilization of 200 local militias or sometent led by the Síndic Francesc Cairat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bondia.ad/cultura/quan-vam-treure-lescopeta|title=Quan vam treure l'escopeta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France, Spain and Portugal. In recent times, however, its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation. Since 1976 the country sees the need to reform Andorran institutions due to the anachronisms in the field of sovereignty, human rights and the balance of powers as well as the need to adapt legislation to modern demands. In 1982 a first separation of powers took place when instituting the Govern d'Andorra, under the name of Executive Board (Consell Executiu), chaired by the first prime minister [[Òscar Ribas Reig]] with the approval of the Co-Princes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elnacional.cat/ca/efemerides/marc-pons-andorra-primer-cap-govern_227061_102.html|title=Andorra tria el primer cap de govern de la seva història|website=ElNacional.cat|access-date=1 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506122057/https://www.elnacional.cat/ca/efemerides/marc-pons-andorra-primer-cap-govern_227061_102.html|archive-date=6 May 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the Principality signed an agreement with the [[European Economic Community]] to regularize trade relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:21990A1231(02)|title=EUR-Lex - 21990A1231(02) - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra is a parliamentary [[co-principality]] with the president of France and the Catholic [[bishop of Urgell]] ([[Catalonia]], Spain) as [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes]]. This peculiarity makes the president of France, in his capacity as [[prince of Andorra]], an elected monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[List of heads of government of Andorra|head of government]] is the [[head of government|chief executive]], and of a [[wikt:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.

The current head of government is [[Xavier Espot Zamora]] of the [[Democrats for Andorra]] (DA). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.

The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 councillors. The councillors serve for four-year terms, and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council.

Half are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes, and the other half of the councillors are elected in a single national constituency. Fifteen days after the election, the councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the head of government is chosen from among the councillors.

[[File:Casa de la Vall - 18.jpg|thumb|Casa de la Vall, the historical and ceremonial Andorran Parliament]]

Candidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be head of government. The Syndic General then notifies the co-princes, who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the head of government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.

[[File:Casa de la Vall, Andorra la Vieja, Andorra, 2013-12-30, DD 03.JPG|thumb|left|The [[New Parliament of Andorra]], headquarters of the [[General Council of Andorra|General Council]] since 2011, next to [[Casa de la Vall]]]]

The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-Princes so that they may sign and enact it.

[[File:Els 7 poetes, Casa de la Vall, Consell General.JPG|thumb|The centre of government in [[Andorra la Vella]]]]

If the head of government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the co-princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn, the councillors have the power to remove the head of government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the head of government is removed.

==Law and criminal justice==
{{Main|Law of Andorra}}
The judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the head of government, one each by the co-princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the judges and magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.

The magistrates and judges are appointed by the High Court, as is the president of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the co-princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court.

==Foreign relations, defence, and security==

[[File:Bruxelles rue de la Montagne 10.jpg|thumb|The embassy of Andorra in [[Brussels]]]]
Andorra does not have its own armed forces,&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; although there is a small ceremonial army. Responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with France and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1993-16868 |title=Documento BOE-A-1993-16868 |publisher=BOE.es |date=30 June 1993 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in case of emergencies or natural disasters, the Sometent (an alarm) is called and all able-bodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turisme.andorralavella.ad/?q=en/node/281 |title=El Sometent &amp;#124; Tourism |publisher=Turisme.andorralavella.ad |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;recarrega.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recarrega.net/arxius/Decret%20veguers%20Sometent,%20del%2023%20d%27octubre%20de%201984.pdf |title=Decret veguers Sometent, del 23 d'octubre de 1984 |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why all Andorrans, and especially the head of each house (usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house) should, by law, keep a rifle, even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in case of need.&lt;ref name=&quot;recarrega.net&quot;/&gt; Andorra is a full member of the United Nations (UN), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), and has a special agreement with the European Union (EU).

===Military===
Andorra has a small army, which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates, but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army. The basic principle of Andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the Sometent. Being a [[landlocked country]], Andorra has no navy.

Before World War I, Andorra maintained an armed force of about 600 part-time militiamen under the supervision of a Captain (Capità or Cap de Sometent) and a Lieutenant (Desener or Lloctinent del Capità). This body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials (veguers) appointed by France and the Bishop of Urgell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policia.ad/historia.html|title=Cos de Policia - Història i identitat|website=Policia.ad|accessdate=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite not being involved in any fighting during the First World War, Andorra was technically the longest combatant, as the country was left out of the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], [[de jure|technically]] remaining at war with Germany from its original declaration of war in 1914 until 24 September 1958 when Andorra officially declared peace with Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;DYKAndorra&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reich |first=Herb |date=2012 |title=Lies They Teach in School: Exposing the Myths Behind 250 Commonly Believed Fallacies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsI_ub0Vh7EC |location=New York |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|page=52 |isbn=9781620873458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties.

The army's role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the [[Police Corps of Andorra]] in 1931. Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the French [[National Gendarmerie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ad.vlex.com/vid/policia-285260|title=De la policia|website=vLex|accessdate=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Andorra.html |title=Andorra |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |date= |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Andorran Police was reformed in the following year, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1157484 |title=Andorra's 'ARMY' – Eleven Permanent Troops! |work=The Times |date=5 January 1934 |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force consisted of six [[Corporal]]s, one for each parish (although there are currently seven parishes, there were only six until 1978), plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action, and a commander with the rank of major. It was the responsibility of the six corporals, each in his own parish, to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish.

Today a small, twelve-man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the Sometent, but all able-bodied men remain technically available for military service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.diariandorra.ad/noticies/dmg/recordes_quan/2018/10/21/els_anhels_andorra_136998_1196.html|title=Els anhels d'Andorra|first=Elisenda Pallarés, Andorra la|last=Vella|date=21 October 2018|website=DiariAndorra.ad|accessdate=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm. A shotgun per household is unregulated. Rifles and pistols require a license.&lt;ref name=&quot;elperiodic.ad&quot;/&gt; The army has not fought for more than 700 years, and its main responsibility is to present the [[flag of Andorra]] at official ceremonial functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aire.ad/documents/10200707_BOP14073Reglament_atm.pdf |title=Bop14073 |date= |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andorramania.com/histoire_gb.htm |title=History of the Principality of Andorra |publisher=Andorramania.com |date=11 December 1997 |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Marc Forné Molné]], Andorra's military budget is strictly from voluntary donations, and the availability of full-time volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/webcast/ga/58/statements/andoeng030925.htm |title=Andorra |publisher=Un.org |date=25 September 2003 |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times there has only been a general emergency call to the popular army of Sometent during the floods of 1982 in the Catalan Pyrenees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elperiodic.ad/opinio/article/27735/82-aiguats|title=La Tribuna - 82 aiguats|website=El Periòdic d'Andorra|accessdate=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; where 12 citizens perished in Andorra, to help the population and establish a public order along with the Local Police units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elperiodic.ad/noticia/27039/la-nit-mes-llarga-en-molts-anys|title=La nit més llarga en molts anys|website=El Periòdic d'Andorra|accessdate=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police Corps===
[[File:Andorra la Vella - Andorra (3137259845).jpg|thumb|[[Police Corps of Andorra|National Police]] patrolling the central area of the capital city]]
{{Main|Police Corps of Andorra}}
Andorra maintains a small but modern and well-equipped internal police force, with around 240 police officers supported by civilian assistants. The principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing, criminal detection, border control, and traffic policing. There are also small specialist units including police dogs, mountain rescue, and a bomb disposal team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carles Iglesias Carril |url=http://www.policia.ad/ |title=Andorran Police Service website |publisher=Policia.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====GIPA====
The ''Grup d'Intervenció Policia d'Andorra'' (GIPA) is a small special forces unit trained in [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Hostage negotiator|hostage recovery]] tasks. Although it is the closest in style to an active military force, it is part of the [[Police Corps of Andorra|Police Corps]], and not the [[Military of Andorra|army]]. As terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the country, the GIPA is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties, and at other times to routine policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carles Iglesias Carril |url=http://www.policia.ad/estructura.html |title=Cos de Policia – Estructura organitzativa |publisher=Policia.ad |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire brigade===
The Andorran Fire Brigade, with headquarters at [[Santa Coloma d'Andorra|Santa Coloma]], operates from four modern fire stations, and has a staff of around 120 firefighters. The service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, turntable ladders, and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), four light support vehicles (cars and vans) and four ambulances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=64 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120722172143/http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=64 |url-status = dead|archive-date=22 July 2012 |title=Vehicle details with extensive photo gallery here |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires. The first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943. Serious fires which lasted for two days in December 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service, and the Andorran Fire Brigade was formed on 21 April 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=44 |title=Fire Brigade history here (in Catalan) |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120801135702/http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=44 |archivedate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time: two at the brigade's headquarters in Santa Coloma, and one crew at each of the other three fire stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad |title=Andorran Fire Service site |publisher=Bombers.ad |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical geography===

Due to its location in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the [[Coma Pedrosa]] at {{convert|2942|m|ft|0}}, and the average elevation of Andorra is {{convert|1996|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of Andorra (1991), Andorran Government. {{oclc|801960401}}. {{in lang|ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the [[Gran Valira]] river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra's lowest point of {{convert|840|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Andorra's land area is {{convert|468|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|0}}.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Andorra belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests.

===Climate===
Andorra has [[alpine climate|alpine]], [[continental climate|continental]] and [[oceanic climate]]s, depending on altitude. Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer. The diversity of landmarks, the different orientation of the valleys and the irregularity relief typical of the [[Mediterranean climate]]s make the country have a great diversity of [[microclimate]]s that hinder the general dominance of the [[Mountain climate|high mountain climate]]. The great differences of altitude in the minimum and maximum points, together with the influence of a Mediterranean climate, develop the climate of the Andorran Pyrenees.

When in precipitation, a global model characterized by convective and abundant rains can be defined during spring and summer, which can last until autumn (May, June and August are usually the rainiest months); In winter, however, it is less rainy, except in the highlands, subject to the influence of fronts from the [[Atlantic Europe|Atlantic]], which explains the great amount of snowfall in the Andorran mountains. The temperature regime is characterized, broadly, by a temperate summer and a long and cold winter; in accordance with the mountainous condition of the Principality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://es.weatherspark.com/y/46004/Clima-promedio-en-Andorra-la-Vella-Andorra-durante-todo-el-a%C3%B1o|title=Clima promedio en Andorra la Vella, Andorra, durante todo el año - Weather Spark|website=es.weatherspark.com|accessdate=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 10.2&amp;nbsp;million tourists visit annually,&lt;ref name=&quot;es2&quot;/&gt; attracted by Andorra's [[duty-free shopping|duty-free]] status and by its summer and winter resorts.

One of the main sources of income in Andorra is tourism from ski resorts which total over {{convert|175|km|0|abbr=on}} of ski ground. The sport brings in over 7 million visitors annually and an estimated 340 million euros per year, sustaining 2,000 direct and 10,000 indirect jobs at present since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://offshorelicense-regulatory.com/about-andorra/|title=About Andorra - Valsen Fiduciaries|website=Offshorelicense-regulatory.com|accessdate=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banking sector, with its [[tax haven]] status, also contributes substantially to the economy (the financial and insurance sector accounts for approximately 19% of GDP&lt;ref name=&quot;fs2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aba.ad/pub/publicaciones/financial_system_2013.pdf|title=Andorra and its financial system 2013|publisher=Aba.ad|accessdate=14 May 2015|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214121805/http://www.aba.ad/pub/publicaciones/financial_system_2013.pdf|archivedate=14 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The financial system comprises five banking groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebanks.eu/banks-by-country/Andorra |title=List of Banks in Andorra |publisher=Thebanks.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; one specialised credit entity, 8 investment undertaking management entities, 3 asset management companies and 29 insurance companies, 14 of which are branches of foreign insurance companies authorised to operate in the principality.&lt;ref name=&quot;fs2013&quot;/&gt;

Agricultural production is limited; only 5% of the land is arable, and most food has to be imported. Some tobacco is grown locally. The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra's natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html |title=CIA World Factbook entry: Andorra |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but enjoys a [[Andorra–European Union relations|special relationship]] with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the [[French franc]] and the [[Spanish peseta]] in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EU's single currency, the euro. Coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002. Andorra negotiated to issue its own euro coins, beginning in 2014.

Andorra has traditionally had one of the world's lowest unemployment rates. In 2009 it stood at 2.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2129rank.html |title=CIA World Factbook: Andorra |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra has long benefited from its status as a tax haven, with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs. However, during the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] of the 21st century, its tourist economy suffered a decline, partly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in Spain, which undercut Andorran [[duty-free shop]]ping. This led to a growth in unemployment. On 1 January 2012, a business tax of 10% was introduced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andorra gets a taste of taxation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/27/andorra-financial-crisis-tax|work=The guardian|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a sales tax of 2% a year later, which raised just over 14 million euros in its first quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra Unveils First Indirect Tax Revenue Figures|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/Andorra_Unveils_First_Indirect_Tax_Revenue_Figures____60703.html|newspaper=Tax News|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2013, it was announced that Andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of an income tax by the end of June, against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among EU members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra to introduce income tax for first time|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22745895|newspaper=BBC News|date=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was made following a meeting in Paris between the Head of Government [[Antoni Marti]] and the French President and Prince of Andorra, [[François Hollande]]. Hollande welcomed the move as part of a process of Andorra &quot;bringing its taxation in line with international standards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.notretemps.com/argent/andorre-aligne-progressivement-sa,i29431|title=Andorre aligne progressivement sa fiscalité sur les standards internationaux (Elysée)|newspaper=Notre Temps|date=31 May 2011|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616031601/http://www.notretemps.com/argent/andorre-aligne-progressivement-sa,i29431|archivedate=16 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Andorra}}
The historic and [[official language]] is [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a [[Romance language]]. The Andorran government encourages the use of Catalan. It funds a Commission for Catalan [[Toponymy]] in Andorra (Catalan: {{lang|ca|Comissió de Toponímia d'Andorra}}), and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants. Andorran television and radio stations use Catalan.

Because of immigration, historical links, and close geographic proximity, Spanish, Portuguese and French are commonly spoken. Most Andorran residents can speak one or more of these, in addition to Catalan. English is less commonly spoken among the general population, though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts. Andorra is one of only four European countries (together with France, Monaco, and Turkey)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/default_en.asp |title=Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCNM) : National Minorities, Council of Europe, 14 September 2010 |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that have never signed the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities|Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=157&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG|title=Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities CETS No. 157 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The population of Andorra is predominantly (88.2%) Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/table-christian-population-as-percentages-of-total-population-by-country/ PEW 2011].

==Education==

===Schools===
Children between the ages of 6 and 16 are required by law to have full-time education. Education up to secondary level is provided free of charge by the government.

There are three systems of school, Andorran, French and Spanish, which use Catalan, French and Spanish languages respectively, as the main language of instruction. Parents may choose which system their children attend. All schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities, but teachers in the French and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by France and Spain. 39% of Andorran children attend Andorran schools, 33% attend French schools, and 28% Spanish schools.

===University of Andorra===
The [[Universitat d'Andorra]] (UdA) is the state public university and is the only university in Andorra. It was established in 1997. The university provides first-level degrees in nursing, computer science, business administration, and educational sciences, in addition to higher professional education courses. The only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and the School of Computer Science, the latter having a PhD programme.

====Virtual Studies Centre====
The geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a full academic programme, and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies, connected to Spanish and French universities. The Virtual Studies Centre (Centre d'Estudis Virtuals) at the University runs approximately 20 different academic degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism, law, Catalan [[philology]], humanities, psychology, political sciences, audiovisual communication, telecommunications engineering, and East Asia studies. The Centre also runs various postgraduate programmes and continuing-education courses for professionals.

Until the 20th century, Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside world, and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation. Even now, the nearest major airports at Toulouse and Barcelona are both three hours' drive from Andorra.

Andorra has a road network of {{convert|279|km|0|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|76|km|0|abbr=on}} is unpaved. The two main roads out of [[Andorra la Vella]] are the CG-1 to the Spanish border near [[Sant Julià de Lòria|Sant Julia de Loria]], and the CG-2 to the French border via the Envalira Tunnel near [[El Pas de la Casa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mobi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilitat.ad/CA/default.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206123122/http://www.mobilitat.ad/CA/default.asp|url-status = dead|archive-date=2007-12-06|title=Agència de Mobilitat, Govern d'Andorra |publisher=Mobilitat.ad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities, with services on most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times.

In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], the '''arithmetic mean''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˌ|æ|r|ɪ|θ|ˈ|m|ɛ|t|ɪ|k|_|ˈ|m|iː|n}}, stress on first and third syllables of &quot;arithmetic&quot;), or simply the [[mean]] or '''average''' when the context is clear, is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jacobs | first = Harold R. | title = Mathematics: A Human Endeavor | edition = Third | year = 1994 | publisher = [[W. H. Freeman]] | page = 547 | isbn = 0-7167-2426-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is often a set of results of an [[experiment]] or an [[observational study]], or frequently a set of results from a [[Survey (statistics)|survey]]. The term &quot;arithmetic mean&quot; is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other [[average|mean]]s, such as the [[geometric mean]] and the [[harmonic mean]].

In addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is used frequently in many diverse fields such as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[history]], and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent. For example, [[per capita income]] is the arithmetic average income of a nation's population.

While the arithmetic mean is often used to report [[central tendency|central tendencies]], it is not a [[robust statistic]], meaning that it is greatly influenced by [[outlier]]s (values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values). Notably, for [[skewed distribution]]s, such as the [[distribution of income]] for which a few people's incomes are substantially greater than most people's, the arithmetic mean may not coincide with one's notion of &quot;middle&quot;, and robust statistics, such as the [[median]], may be a better description of central tendency.

==Definition==
The '''arithmetic mean''' (or '''mean''' or '''average'''), &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; (read &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''bar''), is the mean of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; values &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;JM&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Medhi| first = Jyotiprasad| title = Statistical Methods: An Introductory Text| url = https://books.google.com/?id=bRUwgf_q5RsC| year = 1992| publisher = New Age International| isbn = 9788122404197| pages = 53–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arithmetic mean  is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency in a [[data set]]. In statistics, the term [[average]] refers to any of the measures of central tendency. The arithmetic mean of a set of observed data is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations. Symbolically, if we have a data set consisting of the values &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n&lt;/math&gt;, then the arithmetic mean &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;A=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n a_i=\frac{a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

(See [[summation]] for an explanation of the [[summation operator]]).

For example, consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of a firm: 2500, 2700, 2400, 2300, 2550, 2650, 2750, 2450, 2600, 2400. The arithmetic mean is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{ 2500+ 2700+ 2400+ 2300+ 2550+ 2650+ 2750+ 2450+ 2600+ 2400}{10}=2530.&lt;/math&gt;

If the data set is a [[statistical population]] (i.e., consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them), then the mean of that population is called the '''population mean'''. If the data set is a [[sampling (statistics)|statistical sample]] (a subset of the population), we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a '''sample mean'''.

The arithmetic mean can be similarly defined for [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]] in multiple dimension, not only [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values; this is often referred to as a [[centroid]]. More generally, because the arithmetic mean is a [[convex combination]] (coefficients sum to 1), it can be defined on a [[convex space]], not only a vector space.

==Motivating properties==

The arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful, especially as a measure of central tendency. These include:

* If numbers &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dotsc,x_n&lt;/math&gt; have mean &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(x_1-\bar{x}) + \dotsb + (x_n-\bar{x}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;x_i-\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from a given number to the mean, one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean. The mean is the only single number for which the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] (deviations from the estimate) sum to zero.
* If it is required to use a single number as a &quot;typical&quot; value for a set of known numbers &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dotsc,x_n&lt;/math&gt;, then the arithmetic mean of the numbers does this best, in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the typical value: the sum of &lt;math&gt;(x_i-\bar{x})^2&lt;/math&gt;. (It follows that the sample mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest [[root mean squared error]].)&lt;ref name=&quot;JM&quot;/&gt; If the arithmetic mean of a population of numbers is desired, then the estimate of it that is [[unbiased estimate|unbiased]] is the arithmetic mean of a sample drawn from the population.

==Contrast with median==
{{main|Median}}
The arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the [[median]]. The median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger than, and no more than half are smaller than, the median. If elements in the data [[arithmetic progression|increase arithmetically]], when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal. For example, consider the data sample &lt;math&gt;{1,2,3,4}&lt;/math&gt;. The average is &lt;math&gt;2.5&lt;/math&gt;, as is the median. However, when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically, such as &lt;math&gt;{1,2,4,8,16}&lt;/math&gt;, the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly. In this case, the arithmetic average is 6.2 and the median is 4. In general, the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample, and can be larger or smaller than most of them.

There are applications of this phenomenon in many fields. For example, since the 1980s, the median income in the United States has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Paul |last=Krugman |url=http://prospect.org/article/rich-right-and-facts-deconstructing-inequality-debate |title=The Rich, the Right, and the Facts: Deconstructing the Income Distribution Debate |work=The American Prospect |date=June 4, 2014 |orig-year=Fall 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==

===Weighted average===
{{main|Weighted average}}
A weighted average, or weighted mean, is an average in which some data points count more heavily than others, in that they are given more weight in the calculation. For example, the arithmetic mean of &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{(3+5)}{2} = 4&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3\right) + \left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 5\right) = 4&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, a ''weighted'' mean in which the first number receives, for example, twice as much weight as the second (perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled) would be calculated as &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{2}{3} \cdot 3\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} \cdot 5\right) = \frac{11}{3}&lt;/math&gt;. Here the weights, which necessarily sum to the value one, are &lt;math&gt;(2/3)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(1/3)&lt;/math&gt;, the former being twice the latter. The arithmetic mean (sometimes called the &quot;unweighted average&quot; or &quot;equally weighted average&quot;) can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other (equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; in the above example, and equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; in a situation with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; numbers being averaged).

===Continuous probability distributions===

[[File:Comparison mean median mode.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of two [[log-normal distribution]]s with equal [[median]], but different [[skewness]], resulting in different [[mean]]s and [[mode (statistics)|mode]]s]]

If a numerical property, and any sample of data from it, could take on any value from a continuous range, instead of, for example, just integers, then the [[probability]] of a number falling into some range of possible values can be described by integrating a [[continuous probability distribution]] across this range, even when the naive probability for a sample number taking one certain value from infinitely many is zero. The analog of a weighted average in this context, in which there are an infinite number of possibilities for the precise value of the variable in each range, is called the ''mean of the probability distribution''. A most widely encountered probability distribution is called the [[normal distribution]]; it has the property that all measures of its central tendency, including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the [[Mode (statistics)|mode]] (the three&amp;nbsp;M's&lt;ref name=ThreeMs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/lessons/the-three-ms-of-statistics-mode-median-mean/ |title=The Three M's of Statistics: Mode, Median, Mean June 30, 2010 |website=www.visualthesaurus.com| author= Thinkmap Visual Thesaurus | date=2010-06-30 |accessdate=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;), are equal to each other. This equality does not hold for other probability distributions, as illustrated for the [[lognormal distribution]] here.

==Angles==
{{Main|Mean of circular quantities}}

Particular care must be taken when using cyclic data, such as phases or [[angle]]s. Naively taking the arithmetic mean of 1° and 359° yields a result of 180°.
This is incorrect for two reasons:
* Firstly, angle measurements are only defined up to an additive constant of [[degree (angle)|360°]] (or 2π, if measuring in [[radian]]s). Thus one could as easily call these 1° and −1°, or 361° and 719°, each of which gives a different average.
* Secondly, in this situation, 0° (equivalently, 360°) is geometrically a better ''average'' value: there is lower [[statistical dispersion|dispersion]] about it (the points are both 1° from it, and 179° from 180°, the putative average).

In general application, such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range. A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation ([[viz.]], define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i.e., the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1° and 359° is 2°, not 358°).

== Symbols and encoding ==
The arithmetic mean is often denoted by a bar, for example as in &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; (read &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''bar'').&lt;ref name=&quot;JM&quot;/&gt;

Some software ([[Text processing|text processors]], [[web browser]]s) may not display the x̄ symbol properly. For example, the x̄ symbol in [[HTML]] is actually a combination of two codes - the base letter x plus a code for the line above (&amp;amp;#772; or ¯).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/ejp10/psu/gotunicode/statsym.html|title=Notes on Unicode for Stat Symbols|website=www.personal.psu.edu|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some texts, such as [[PDF|pdfs]], the x̄ symbol may be replaced by a [[Euro coins|cent]] (¢) symbol ([[Unicode]] &amp;#162) when copied to text processor such as [[Microsoft Word]].

The '''American Football Conference''' ('''AFC''') is one of the two [[Conference (sports)|conferences]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the highest professional level of American football in the United States. This conference and its counterpart the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC), currently contain 16 teams organized into 4 [[Division (sport)|divisions]]. Both conferences were created as part of the [[AFL–NFL merger|1970 merger]] with the rival [[American Football League]] (AFL), with all ten of the former AFL teams and three NFL teams forming the AFC, and the remaining thirteen NFL clubs forming the NFC. A series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger, thus making the current total of 16 clubs in each conference. The current AFC champions are the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], who defeated the [[Tennessee Titans]] in the 2019 [[AFC Championship Game]] for their first conference championship in team history.

==Teams==
Like the NFC, the conference has 16 teams organized into four [[Division (sport)|divisions]] each with four teams: [[AFC East|East]], [[AFC North|North]], [[AFC South|South]] and [[AFC West|West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25549819/2019-nfl-pro-bowl-selections-all-32-teams-full-nfc-afc-rosters|title=2019 Pro Bowl selections for every team: Full NFC, AFC rosters|date=2018-12-19|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/sports/football/parity-afc-becomes-a-conference-of-haves-and-have-nots.html|title=Parity?

This chart of the [[2019 NFL season#Regular season standings|2019 season standings]] displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula. The [[2019 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs in 2019]] (highlighted in green) finished in first place in the [[AFC West]]. Thus, [[2020 Kansas City Chiefs season|in 2020]], the Chiefs will play two games against each of its division rivals (highlighted in light blue), one game against each team in the [[AFC East]] and [[NFC South]] (highlighted in yellow), and one game each against the first-place finishers in the [[AFC North]] and [[AFC South]] (highlighted in orange).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Currently, the thirteen opponents each team faces over the 16-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Opponents Determined|url=http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/2012-opponents-determined.pdf|publisher=[[National Football League|NFL]]|accessdate=January 23, 2012|date=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each AFC team plays the other teams in their respective division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL. Two of these games are assigned on the basis of a particular team's final divisional standing from the previous season. The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle. Using the 2012 regular season schedule as an example, each team in the AFC West plays against every team in the AFC North and NFC South. In this way, non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the exception being the two games assigned based on the team's prior-season divisional standing.

At the end of each season, the four division winners and two [[wild card (sports)|wild cards]] (non-division winners with best regular season record) in the AFC qualify for the [[National Football League playoffs|playoffs]]. The AFC playoffs culminate in the [[AFC Championship Game]] with the winner receiving the [[Lamar Hunt]] Trophy. The AFC Champion then plays the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Champion in the [[Super Bowl]].

==History==
[[File:Oldafclogo.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Original American Football Conference logo, based on the AFL logo with blue stars]]
Both the AFC and the NFC were created after the NFL [[AFL–NFL merger|merged]] with the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldalmanacforkids.com/WAKI-ViewArticle.aspx?pin=x-fo055624a&amp;article_id=608&amp;chapter_id=13&amp;chapter_title=Sports&amp;article_title=Pro_Football_History|title=Pro Football – History|access-date=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, and added two more expansion clubs (the [[Miami Dolphins]] in 1966 and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in 1968) before the merger. In order to equalize the number of teams in each conference, three NFL teams that predated the AFL's launch (the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and the then-[[Baltimore Colts]]) joined the ten former AFL teams to form the AFC. The two AFL divisions [[AFL East]] and [[AFL West]] were more or less intact, while the NFL's [[National Football League Century Division|Century Division]], in which the Browns and the Steelers had played since 1967, was moved from the NFL to become the new AFC Central. Upon the completion of the merger of the AFL and NFL in 1970, the newly-minted American Football Conference had already agreed upon their divisional setup along mostly geographical lines for the [[1970 NFL season|1970 season]]; the National Football Conference, however, could not agree upon their setup, and one was chosen from a fishbowl on January 16, 1970.

Since the merger, five expansion teams have joined the AFC and two have left, thus making the current total 16. When the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively. This arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences. The Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC as a result of the [[2002 NFL season#Expansion and realignment|2002 realignment]]. The expansion [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] joined the AFC in 1995. There have been five teams that have relocated at least once. In 1984, the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|relocated]] to Indianapolis. In 1995, the [[Cleveland Browns]] had attempted to move to Baltimore; the resulting [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|dispute]] between Cleveland and the team led to Modell establishing the [[Baltimore Ravens]] with the players and personnel from the Browns, while the Browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the NFL. The Ravens were treated as an expansion team.

In [[California]], the [[Oakland Raiders]] relocated to [[Los Angeles]] in 1982, back to Oakland in 1995, and then to [[Las Vegas]] in 2020, while the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] returned to [[Los Angeles]] in 2017 after 56 years in [[San Diego]].

The [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]] moved to [[Tennessee]] in 1997, where they were renamed the Tennessee Oilers. The team would change its name again, two years later, to the [[Tennessee Titans]].

The NFL would again expand in 2002, adding the [[Houston Texans]] to the AFC. With the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time, the divisional setup has remained static ever since.

Between 1995 and 2019, the AFC has sent only half of its 16 teams to the [[Super Bowl]]: [[New England Patriots]] (10 times), [[Denver Broncos]] (4 times), [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (4 times), [[Baltimore Ravens]] (2 times), [[Indianapolis Colts]] (2 times), [[Kansas City Chiefs]] (1 time), [[Las Vegas Raiders]] (1 time), and [[Tennessee Titans]] (1 time). By contrast, the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] has sent 13 of the 16 NFC teams during that same time frame with only the [[Detroit Lions]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], and [[Washington Football Team]] missing out on an appearance in the [[Super Bowl]]. 16 of the last 19 AFC champions have started one of just three quarterbacks - [[Tom Brady]], [[Peyton Manning]] and [[Ben Roethlisberger]] - in the Super Bowl. The AFC has started 6 quarterbacks in the last 19 Super Bowls, while the NFC has started 16.

==Logo==
[[Image:American Football Conference logo old.svg|right|thumb|2nd American Football Conference logo used from 1970 to 2009|216x216px]]
The merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the old AFL logo, specifically the &quot;A&quot; and the six stars surrounding it. The AFC logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009. The 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo, with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars (leaving four representing the four divisions of the AFC), and moving the stars inside the letter, similar to the NFC logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/ |title=But I Absolutely Refuse to Write About the Draft Caps |author=Paul Lukas |publisher=Uni Watch blog |access-date=April 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506134900/http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/ |archivedate=May 6, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
[[NFL on NBC|NBC]] aired the AFC's Sunday afternoon and playoff games from 1970 through the 1997 season. From 1998 to 2013, [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] was the primary broadcast rightsholder to the AFC; in those years, all interconference games in which the AFC team was the visiting team were broadcast on either NBC or CBS. Since 2014, the cross-flex policy allows select AFC games (that involve them playing an NFC team at home or intraconference games) to be moved from CBS to Fox. Since 1990, select AFC playoffs games have been seen on ABC or ESPN.

'''''Animal Farm''''' is an [[allegory|allegorical]] [[novella]] by [[George Orwell]], first published in England on 17 August 1945.{{sfn|Bynum|2012}}{{sfn|12 Things You|2015}} The book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. Ultimately, however, the rebellion is betrayed, and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before, under the dictatorship of a pig named [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]].

According to Orwell, the [[fable]] reflects events leading up to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and then on into the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|Stalinist era]] of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Gcse English Literature}}{{sfn|Meija|2002}}  Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],{{sfn|Orwell |2014 |p=23}} was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and hostile to Moscow-directed [[Stalinism]], an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Bowker |2013|p=235}}{{efn| Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''[[The Spanish Cockpit]]'' in ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'', 31 July 1937, and &quot;Spilling the Spanish Beans&quot;, ''New English Weekly'', 29 July 1937}} The Soviet Union had become a brutal [[dictatorship]] built upon a [[cult of personality]] and enforced by [[great purge|a reign of terror]]. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as a [[satire|satirical]] tale against Stalin (&quot;''{{lang|fr|un conte satirique contre Staline}}''&quot;),{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay &quot;[[Why I Write]]&quot; (1946), wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, &quot;to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole&quot;.{{sfn|Orwell|2014|p=10}}

The original title was ''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story,'' but U.S. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime kept it. Other titular variations include subtitles like &quot;A Satire&quot; and &quot;A Contemporary Satire&quot;.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} Orwell suggested the title ''{{lang|fr|Union des républiques socialistes animales}}'' for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the [[Latin]] word for &quot;bear&quot;, a [[Russian bear|symbol of Russia]]. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, ''{{lang|fr|Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques}}''.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}}

Orwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the United Kingdom was in its [[Allies of World War II|wartime alliance]] with the Soviet Union against [[Nazi Germany]], and the British intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, a phenomenon Orwell hated.{{efn|[[Bradbury, Malcolm]], Introduction |p=vi, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition, 1989}} The manuscript was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers,{{sfn|''Animal Farm'': Sixty}} including one of Orwell's own, [[Victor Gollancz]], which delayed its publication. It became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Dickstein |2007 |p= 134}}

''Time'' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]],{{Sfn|Modern Library|1998}} and number 46 on the [[BBC]]'s [[The Big Read]] poll.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml &quot;BBC&amp;nbsp;– The Big Read&quot;]. BBC. April 2003. Retrieved 22 March 2020&lt;/ref&gt; It won a [[Retro-Hugo|Retrospective Hugo Award]] in 1996{{Sfn|The Hugo Awards|1996}} and is included in the [[Great Books of the Western World]] selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Western books&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prodigalnomore.wordpress.com/great-books-of-the-western-world-as-free-ebooks/ |website=prodigalnomore.wordpress.com|title=Great Books of the Western World as Free eBooks|date=5 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The poorly-run Manor Farm near [[Willingdon and Jevington|Willingdon]], [[England]], is ripened for rebellion from its animal populace by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmer, [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]]. One night, the exalted boar, [[Old Major]], organizes a meeting, at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called &quot;[[Beasts of England]]&quot;. When Old Major dies, two young pigs, [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] and [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], assume command and stage a revolt, driving Mr. Jones off the farm and renaming the property &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, &quot;All animals are equal&quot;. The decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn. Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of [[#Animalism|Animalism]]. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Jones and his associates to retake the farm (later dubbed the &quot;Battle of the Cowshed&quot;), Snowball announces his plans to modernize the farm by building a [[windmill]]. Napoleon argues against this idea, and matters come to head, which culminate in Napoleon's dogs chasing Snowball away and Napoleon declaring himself supreme commander.

Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young pig named [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]], Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea, claiming that Snowball actually was only trying to win animals to his side. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project and begin to [[purge]] the farm of animals Napoleon accuses of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who was nowhere to be found during the battle) gradually smears Snowball to the point of saying he is a collaborator of Mr. Jones, even dismissing the fact that Snowball was given an award of courage while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle. &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is replaced with &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, while an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man (&quot;Comrade Napoleon&quot;), is composed and sung. Many animals who later claim to be helping Snowball in plots are executed by Napoleon's dogs, which troubles the rest of the animals. Despite their hardships, the animals are easily placated by Napoleon's retort that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones, as well as by the sheep's continual bleating of “four legs good, two legs bad”.

Mr. Frederick, a neighbouring farmer, attacks the farm, using [[Explosive material|blasting powder]] to blow up the restored windmill. Although the animals win the battle, they do so [[Pyrrhic victory|at great cost]], as many, including [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer the workhorse]], are wounded. Although he recovers from this, Boxer eventually collapses while working on the windmill (being almost 12 years old at that point). He is taken away in a [[knacker]]'s van, and a donkey called Benjamin alerts the animals of this, but Squealer quickly waves off their alarm by persuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. Squealer subsequently reports Boxer's death and honours him with a festival the following day. (However, Napoleon had in fact engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy [[whisky]] for themselves.)

Years pass, the windmill is rebuilt, and another windmill is constructed, which makes the farm a good amount of income. However, the ideals that Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating, and running water, are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives. In addition to Boxer, many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old. Mr. Jones, having moved away after giving up on reclaiming his farm, has also died. The pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, drink alcohol, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to just one phrase: ''&quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&quot;'' The maxim ''&quot;Four legs good, two legs bad&quot;'' is changed to ''&quot;Four legs good, two legs better.&quot;'' Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name &quot;The Manor Farm&quot;. The men and pigs start playing cards, flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game. Both Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington, one of the farmers, play the [[Ace of spades|Ace of Spades]] at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first. When the animals outside look at the pigs and men, they can no longer distinguish between the two.

==Characters==

===Pigs===
* [[Old Major]] – An aged prize [[Middle White|Middle White boar]] provides the inspiration that fuels the rebellion. He is an allegorical combination of [[Karl Marx]], one of the creators of communism, and [[Vladimir Lenin]], the communist leader of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the early Soviet nation, in that he draws up the principles of the revolution. His skull being put on revered public display recalls Lenin, whose [[Lenin's Mausoleum|embalmed body was put on display]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}} By the end of the book, the skull is reburied.
* [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]] – &quot;A large, rather fierce-looking [[Berkshire pig|Berkshire]] boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way&quot;.{{sfn|Orwell|1979|loc=chapter II|p=15}} An allegory of [[Joseph Stalin]],{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}}  Napoleon is the leader of ''Animal Farm''. 
* [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] – Napoleon's rival and original head of the farm after Jones' overthrow. His life parallels that of [[Leon Trotsky]],{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}}  but may also combine elements from Lenin.{{sfn|Hitchens|2008|pp=186ff}}{{efn|According to [[Christopher Hitchens]], &quot;the persons of Lenin and Trotsky are combined into one [i.e., Snowball], or, it might even be [...] to say, there is no Lenin at all.&quot;{{sfn|Hitchens|2008|pp=186ff}}}}
* [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]] – A small, white, fat porker who serves as Napoleon's second-in-command and minister of propaganda, holding a position similar to that of [[Vyacheslav Molotov]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}}
* Minimus – A poetic pig who writes the second and third national anthems of Animal Farm after the singing of &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is banned. Rodden compares him to the poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|p=11}}
* The piglets – Hinted to be the children of Napoleon and are the first generation of animals subjugated to his idea of animal inequality.
* The young pigs – Four pigs who complain about Napoleon's takeover of the farm but are quickly silenced and later executed, the first animals killed in Napoleon's farm purge. Probably based on the [[Great Purge]] of [[Grigori Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]], and [[Alexei Rykov]].
* Pinkeye – A minor pig who is mentioned only once; he is the pig that tastes Napoleon's food to make sure it is not poisoned, in response to rumours about an assassination attempt on Napoleon.

===Humans===
* [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]] – A heavy drinker who is the original owner of Manor Farm, a farm in disrepair with farmhands who often loaf on the job. He is an allegory of Russian [[Tsar Nicholas II]],{{sfn|Fall of Mister}} who abdicated following the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and was murdered, along with the rest of his family, by the [[Bolsheviks]] on 17 July 1918. The animals revolt after Jones drinks so much he does not care for them.
* Mr. Frederick – The tough owner of Pinchfield, a small but well-kept neighbouring farm, who briefly enters into an alliance with Napoleon.{{sfn|Sparknotes &quot; Literature}}{{sfn|Scheming Frederick how}}{{sfn|Meyers|1975 |p=141}}{{sfn|Bloom|2009}} Animal Farm shares land boundaries with Pinchfield on one side and Foxwood on another, making Animal Farm a &quot;buffer zone&quot; between the two bickering farmers. The animals of Animal Farm are terrified of Frederick, as rumours abound of him abusing his animals and entertaining himself with [[cockfighting]] (a likely allegory for the human rights abuses of [[Adolf Hitler]]). Napoleon enters into an alliance with Frederick in order to sell surplus timber that Pilkington also sought, but is enraged to learn Frederick paid him in counterfeit money. Shortly after the swindling, Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm, killing many animals and destroying the windmill. The brief alliance and subsequent invasion may allude to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[Operation Barbarossa]].{{sfn|Meyers|1975|p=141}}{{sfn| Firchow |2008 |p=102}}{{sfn| Davison |1996|p= 161}}
* Mr. Pilkington – The easy-going but crafty and well-to-do owner of Foxwood, a large neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds. Pilkington is wealthier than Frederick and owns more land, but his farm is in need of care as opposed to Frederick's smaller but more efficiently run farm. Although on bad terms with Frederick, Pilkington is also concerned about the animal revolution that deposed Jones and worried that this could also happen to him.
* Mr. Whymper – A man hired by Napoleon to act as the liaison between Animal Farm and human society. At first, he is used to acquire necessities that cannot be produced on the farm, such as dog biscuits and [[paraffin wax]], but later he procures luxuries like alcohol for the pigs.

===Equines===
* [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] – A loyal, kind, dedicated, extremely strong, hard-working, and respectable cart-horse, although quite naive and gullible.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Boxer does a large share of the physical labour on the farm. He is shown to hold the belief that &quot;Napoleon is always right.&quot; At one point, he had challenged Squealer's statement that Snowball was always against the welfare of the farm, earning him an attack from Napoleon's dogs. But Boxer's immense strength repels the attack, worrying the pigs that their authority can be challenged. Boxer has been compared to [[Alexey Stakhanov]], a diligent and enthusiastic role model of the [[Stakhanovite movement]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|p=12}} He has been described as &quot;faithful and strong&quot;;{{sfn|Sutherland|2005|pp=17–19}} he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder.{{sfn|Roper|1977|pp=11–63}} When Boxer is injured, Napoleon sells him to a local [[knacker]] to buy himself whisky, and Squealer gives a moving account, falsifying Boxer's death.
* Mollie – A self-centred, self-indulgent, and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution, in a manner similar to those who left Russia after the fall of the Tsar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm/characters/|title=Animal Farm Characters|last=SparkNotes Editors.|date=2007|website=SparkNotes|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is only once mentioned again.
* Clover – A gentle, caring mare, who shows concern especially for Boxer, who often pushes himself too hard. Clover can read all the letters of the alphabet, but cannot &quot;put words together&quot;. She seems to catch on to the sly tricks and schemes set up by Napoleon and Squealer.
* [[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]] – A donkey, one of the oldest, wisest animals on the farm, and one of the few who can read properly. He is sceptical, temperamental and cynical: his most frequent remark is, &quot;Life will go on as it has always gone on – that is, badly.&quot;  The academic Morris Dickstein has suggested there is &quot;a touch of Orwell himself in this creature's timeless scepticism&quot;{{sfn|Dickstein |2007|p=141}} and indeed, friends called Orwell &quot;Donkey George&quot;, &quot;after his grumbling donkey Benjamin, in ''Animal Farm''.&quot;{{sfn|Orwell|2006 |p=236}}

===Other animals===
* Muriel – A wise old goat who is friends with all of the animals on the farm. Similarly to Benjamin, Muriel is one of the few animals on the farm who is not a pig but can read.
* The puppies – Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, the puppies were taken away at birth by Napoleon and raised by him to serve as his powerful security force.
* Moses – The Raven, &quot;Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Initially following Mrs. Jones into exile, he reappears several years later and resumes his role of talking but not working. He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called &quot;Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!&quot; Orwell portrays [[Religion and politics|established religion]] as &quot;the black raven of priestcraft – promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power.&quot; Napoleon brings the Raven back (Ch. IX), as Stalin brought back the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Dickstein|2007|p= 141}}
* The sheep – They show limited understanding of Animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm, yet nonetheless they are the voice of blind conformity{{sfn|Dickstein|2007|p=141}} as they bleat their support Napoleon's ideals with jingles during his speeches and meetings with Snowball. Their constant bleating of &quot;four legs good, two legs bad&quot; was used as a device to drown out any opposition or alternative views from Snowball, much as Stalin used hysterical crowds to drown out Trotsky.{{sfn|Meyers|1975|p=122}} Towards the latter section of the book, Squealer (the propagandist) trains the sheep to alter their slogan to &quot;four legs good, two legs better,&quot; which they dutifully do.
* The hens – The hens are promised at the start of the revolution that they will get to keep their eggs, which are stolen from them under Mr. Jones. However, their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside Animal Farm. The hens are among the first to rebel, albeit unsuccessfully, against Napoleon.
* The cows – The cows are enticed into the revolution by promises that their milk will not be stolen but can be used to raise their own calves. Their milk is then stolen by the pigs, who learn to milk them. The milk is stirred into the pigs' mash every day, while the other animals are denied such luxuries.
* The cat – Never seen to carry out any work, the cat is absent for long periods and is forgiven because her excuses are so convincing and she &quot;purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions.&quot;{{sfn|Orwell|2009|p=52}} She has no interest in the politics of the farm, and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election, she is found to have actually &quot;voted on both sides.&quot;{{sfn|Orwell|2009|p=25}}

== Genre/Style ==
George Orwell's ''Animal Farm'' is an example of a political satire that was intended to have a &quot;wider application,&quot; according to Orwell himself, in terms of its relevance.&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dwan|first=David|date=2012|title=Orwell's Paradox: Equality in ''Animal Farm''|journal=ELH|volume=79|issue=3|pages=655–83|doi=10.1353/elh.2012.0025|issn=1080-6547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistically, the work shares many similarities with some of Orwell's other works, most notably ''1984,'' as both have been considered works of Swiftian Satire.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crick|first=Bernard|date=December 31, 1983|title=The real message of '1984': Orwell's Classic Re-assessed |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&amp;docref=news/1139870DADC7F880|journal=Financial Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, these two prominent works seem to suggest Orwell's bleak view of the future for humanity; he seems to stress the potential/current threat of dystopias similar to those in ''Animal Farm'' and ''1984''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rosariomariocapalbo.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/george-orwell-dystopian-novel-1984-animal-farm/|title=George Orwell: Dystopian Novel – 1984 – Animal Farm |last=rosariomario|date=2011-04-10|website=Spazio personale di mario aperto a tutti 24 ore su|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these kinds of works, Orwell distinctly references the disarray and traumatic conditions of Europe following the Second World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;:52&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orwell|first=George|date=|title=Politics and the English Language|journal=Literary Cavalcade|volume=54|pages=20–26|id={{ProQuest|210475382}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell's style and writing philosophy as a whole was very concerned with the pursuit of truth in writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KnowledgeNotes|date=1996|title=Animal Farm|journal=Signet Classic|volume=|pages=|id={{ProQuest|2137893954}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell was committed to communicating in a way that was straightforward, given the way that he felt words were commonly used in politics to deceive and confuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; For this reason, he is careful, in ''Animal Farm'', to make sure the narrator speaks in an unbiased and uncomplicated fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; The difference is seen in the way that the animals speak and interact, as the generally moral animals seem to speak their minds clearly, while the wicked animals on the farm, such as Napoleon, twist language in such a way that it meets their own insidious desires.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; This style reflects Orwell's close proximation to the issues facing Europe at the time and his determination to comment critically on Stalin's Soviet Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

== Background ==

=== Origin ===
George Orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 after his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which he described in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938). In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of ''Animal Farm'', he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him &quot;how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the [[Stalinist]] corruption of the original socialist ideals.{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}} ''Homage to Catalonia'' sold poorly; after seeing [[Arthur Koestler]]'s best-selling, ''[[Darkness at Noon]],'' about the same war, Orwell decided that fiction was the best way to describe totalitarianism.{{r|dalrymple20190824}}

Immediately prior to writing the book, Orwell had quit the [[BBC]]. He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out. The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination.{{sfn|Overy |1997 |p=297}}

In the preface, Orwell described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm:{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}}
{{quote
|...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.
}}

==Publication==

===Publishing===
Orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published, largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Four publishers refused to publish ''Animal Farm'', yet one had initially accepted the work, but declined it after consulting the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}}{{efn|[[#GOIT|Orwell 1976 p. 25 ''La libertà di stampa'']]}} Eventually, [[Secker and Warburg]] published the first edition in 1945.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch – including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. He also submitted the manuscript to [[Faber and Faber]], where the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book's &quot;good writing&quot; and &quot;fundamental integrity&quot;, but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint &quot;which I take to be generally [[Deformed workers' state|Trotskyite]]&quot;. Eliot said he found the view &quot;not convincing&quot;, and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue &quot;what was needed... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs&quot;.{{sfn|Eliot|1969}} Orwell let [[André Deutsch]], who was working for Nicholson &amp; Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson &amp; Watson would want to publish it; however, they did not, and &quot;lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in ''Animal Farm''.&quot;{{sfn|Orwell |2013|p= 231}} In his ''London Letter'' on 17 April 1944 for ''[[Partisan Review]]'', Orwell wrote that it was &quot;now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed. Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle.&quot;

The publisher [[Jonathan Cape]], who had initially accepted ''Animal Farm'', subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off{{sfn|Whitewashing of Stalin |2008}} – although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=337}} Writing to [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], a partner in the literary agency of Christy &amp; Moore, publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable, and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. It may reasonably be assumed that the &quot;important official&quot; was a man named [[Peter Smollett]], who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent.{{sfn| Leab  |2007 |p= 3}}  Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka, and he would be one of the names Orwell [[Orwell's list|included in his list]] of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the [[Information Research Department]] in 1949. The publisher wrote to Orwell, saying:{{sfn|Whitewashing of Stalin |2008}}
{{quote |
If the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right, but the fable does follow, as I see now, so completely the progress of the Russian Soviets and their two dictators [Lenin and Stalin], that it can apply only to Russia, to the exclusion of the other dictatorships.

Another thing: it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs. I think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people, and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are.
}}

[[Frederic Warburg]] also faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the heroic [[Red Army]],{{sfn|Fyvel|1982 |p=139}} which had [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|played a major part]] in defeating [[Adolf Hitler]]. A Russian translation was printed in the paper ''Posev'', and in giving permission for a Russian translation of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell refused in advance all royalties. A translation in Ukrainian, which was produced in Germany, was confiscated in large part by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission.{{efn|[[Struve, Gleb]]. ''Telling the Russians'', written for the Russian journal ''New Russian Wind'', reprinted in Remembering Orwell |pp=260–61}}

In October 1945, Orwell wrote to Frederic Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] might illustrate ''Animal Farm''. Low had written a letter saying that he had had &quot;a good time with ''ANIMAL FARM'' – an excellent bit of satire – it would illustrate perfectly.&quot; Nothing came of this, and a trial issue produced by Secker &amp; Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned, but the [[Folio Society]] published an edition in 1984 illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]] and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist [[Ralph Steadman]] was published by Secker &amp; Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of ''Animal Farm''.{{sfn|Orwell|2001|p= 123 }}{{sfn|Orwell|2015|pp= 313–14}}

===Preface===
Orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British [[self-censorship]] and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally:
{{quote|The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary.... Things are kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that 'it wouldn't do' to mention that particular fact.}}
Although the first edition allowed space for the preface, it was not included,{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}} and as of June 2009 most editions of the book have not included it.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Secker and Warburg published the first edition of ''Animal Farm'' in 1945 without an introduction. However, the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author's proof composited from the manuscript. For reasons unknown, no preface was supplied, and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute.{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}}

In 1972, [[Ian Angus (librarian)|Ian Angus]] found the original typescript titled &quot;The Freedom of the Press&quot;, and [[Bernard Crick]] published it, together with his own introduction, in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 15 September 1972 as &quot;How the essay came to be written&quot;.{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}}  Orwell's essay criticised British self-censorship by the press, specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government.{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}} The same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 edition of ''Animal Farm'' with another introduction by Crick, claiming to be the first edition with the preface. Other publishers were still declining to publish it.{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=more details needed, were some actively refusing, unaware of the preface?}}

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive. Writing in the American ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' magazine, George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book, writing that it &quot;puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly.&quot; Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real-world inspirations, and said, &quot;It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well&quot;.{{sfn|Soule|1946}}

''[[The Guardian]]'' on 24 August 1945 called ''Animal Farm'' &quot;a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few&quot;.{{sfn|Books of day|1945}}  [[Tosco Fyvel]], writing in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' on the same day, called the book &quot;a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us.&quot; [[Julian Symons]] responded, on 7 September, &quot;Should we not expect, in ''Tribune'' at least, acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State – Soviet Russia? It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground. In a hundred years time perhaps, ''Animal Farm'' may be simply a fairy story; today it is a political satire with a good deal of point.&quot; ''Animal Farm'' has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.{{sfn|Orwell | 2015|p= 253}}

The [[CIA]], from 1952 to 1957 in Operation Aedinosaur, sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down.&lt;ref name=&quot;dalrymple20190824&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Dalrymple |first=William |author-link=William Dalrymple (historian) |title=Novel explosives of the Cold War |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/08/novel-explosives-of-the-cold-war/ |magazine=The Spectator |archive-url=https://outline.com/X9SnJv |archive-date=2019-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine chose ''Animal Farm'' as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]].{{Sfn|Modern Library|1998}} It won a [[Retro-Hugo|Retrospective Hugo Award]] in 1996 and is included in the [[Great Books of the Western World]] selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Western books&quot;/&gt;

Popular reading in schools, ''Animal Farm''  was ranked the nation's favourite book from school in a 2016 UK poll&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=George Orwell's Animal Farm tops list of the nation's favourite books from school |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/george-orwells-animal-farm-tops-list-of-the-nations-favourite-books-from-school-a6994351.html |accessdate=15 December 2019 |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Animal Farm'' has also faced an array of challenges in school settings around the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/classics|title=Banned &amp; Challenged Classics|last=admin|date=2013-03-26|website=Advocacy, Legislation &amp; Issues|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are examples of this controversy that has existed around Orwell's work:
* The [[John Birch Society]] in Wisconsin challenged the reading of ''Animal Farm'' in 1965 because of its reference to masses revolting.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bannedlibrary.com/podcast/2017/1/22/animal-farm-and-other-books-not-meant-for-children|title=Animal Farm by George Orwell|website=Banned Library|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* New York State English Council's Committee on Defense Against Censorship found that in 1968, ''Animal Farm'' had been widely deemed a &quot;problem book.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* A censorship survey conducted in DeKalb County, Georgia, relating to the years 1979–1982, revealed that many schools had attempted to limit access to ''Animal Farm'' due to its &quot;political theories.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* Superintendent in Bay County, Florida, bans ''Animal Farm'' at the middle school and high school levels in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
** The Board quickly brought back the book, however, after receiving complaints of the ban as &quot;unconstitutional&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==Analysis==

===Animalism===
{{Redirect|Seven Commandments|the Noahide code|Seven Laws of Noah}}

The pigs Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer adapt Old Major's ideas into &quot;a complete system of thought&quot;, which they formally name Animalism, an allegoric reference to [[Communism]], not to be confused with [[Animalism (philosophy)|the philosophy Animalism]]. Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with the humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading), which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments. Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation, an [[allusion]] to the Soviet government's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society.{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pages=48–49}}
[[File:Animal Farm artwork.jpg|thumb|Squealer sprawls at the foot of the end wall of the big barn where the Seven Commandments were written (ch. viii) – preliminary artwork for a 1950 strip cartoon by [[Norman Pett]] and Donald Freeman]]

The original commandments are:
# Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
# Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
# No animal shall wear clothes.
# No animal shall sleep in a bed.
# No animal shall drink alcohol.
# No animal shall kill any other animal.
# All animals are equal.

These commandments are also distilled into the maxim &quot;Four legs good, two legs bad!&quot; which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm, often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of Animalism.

Later, Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking. The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded:
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No animal shall sleep in a bed '''with sheets'''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No animal shall drink alcohol '''to excess'''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No animal shall kill any other animal '''without cause'''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Eventually, these are replaced with the maxims, &quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others&quot;, and &quot;Four legs good, two legs better&quot; as the pigs become more human. This is an [[Irony|ironic]] twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political [[dogma]] can be turned into malleable [[propaganda]].{{sfn|Carr|2010|pp=78–79}}

===Significance and allegory===
[[File:Flag_of_the_Animal_Farm.svg|thumb|left|The Horn and Hoof flag described in the book appears to be based on the [[hammer and sickle]], the Communist symbol. By the end of the book, the Hoof and Horn is removed.]]
Orwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written, &quot;virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory.&quot;{{sfn|Meyers|1975|p=249}} Orwell himself wrote in 1946, &quot;Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution... [and] ''that kind'' of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power-hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters [-] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert.&quot;{{sfn|Orwell|2013|page=334}} In a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition, he stated, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;for the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement. On my return from Spain [in 1937] I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages.&quot;{{sfn|Crick |2019 |p=450}}

The revolt of the animals against Farmer Jones is Orwell's analogy with the [[October Revolution|October 1917 Bolshevik Revolution]]. The ''Battle of the Cowshed'' has been said to represent the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|allied invasion]] of [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] in 1918,{{sfn| Davison| 1996|p= 161}} and the defeat of the [[White movement|White Russians]] in the [[Russian Civil War]].{{sfn| Firchow |2008 |p=102}}  The pigs' rise to preeminence mirrors the rise of a Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR, just as Napoleon's emergence as the farm's sole leader reflects Stalin's emergence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fod.infobase.com/p_ViewVideo.aspx?xtid=129225|title=Animal Farm|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Films on Demand|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pigs' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use, &quot;the turning point of the story&quot; as Orwell termed it in a letter to [[Dwight Macdonald]],{{sfn|Orwell|2013|page=334}} stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left-wing 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt revolt]] against the Bolsheviks, {{sfn|Orwell|2013|page=334}} and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plans]]. The puppies controlled by Napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the Stalinist structure, and the pigs' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s.{{sfn|  Leab| 2007 |pp=6–7}} In chapter seven, when the animals confess their non-existent crimes and are killed, Orwell directly alludes to the purges, confessions and [[Moscow show trials|show trials]] of the late 1930s. These contributed to Orwell's conviction that the Bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the Soviet system become rotten.{{sfn|Dickstein  |2007|p= 135 }}

[[Peter Edgerly Firchow]] and [[Peter Davison (professor)|Peter Davison]] contend that the ''Battle of the Windmill,'' specifically referencing ''the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Battle of Moscow]],''  represents [[World War II]].{{sfn|Firchow|2008|p=102}}{{sfn| Davison |1996|p= 161}} During the battle, Orwell first wrote, &quot;All the animals, including Napoleon&quot; took cover. Orwell had the publisher alter this to &quot;All the animals except Napoleon&quot; in recognition of Stalin's decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance.{{sfn|Meyers| 1975 |p=142}} Orwell requested the change after he met [[Józef Czapski]] in Paris in March 1945. Czapski, a survivor of the [[Katyn Massacre]] and an opponent of the Soviet regime, told Orwell, as Orwell wrote to [[Arthur Koestler]], that it had been &quot;the character [and] greatness of Stalin&quot; that saved Russia from the German invasion.{{efn|A Note on the Text, Peter Davison, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition 1989 |p=xx}}

[[File:15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).jpg|thumb|Front row (left to right): [[Alexey Rykov|Rykov]], [[Mykola Skrypnyk|Skrypnyk]], and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] – 'When Snowball comes to the crucial points in his speeches he is drowned out by the sheep (Ch. V), just as in the [[15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|party Congress in 1927]] [above], at Stalin's instigation 'pleas for the opposition were drowned in the continual, hysterically intolerant uproar from the floor'. ([[Isaac Deutscher]]{{sfn|Meyers| 1975|pp= 138, 311}})]]

Other connections that writers have suggested illustrate Orwell's telescoping of Russian history from 1917 to 1943{{sfn|Meyers |1975|p= 135}}{{efn| In the Preface to ''Animal Farm'' Orwell noted, however, 'although various episodes are taken from the actual history of the Russian Revolution, they are dealt with schematically and their chronological order is changed.'}} include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the Rebellion, which stands for the abortive revolutions [[Hungarian Revolution of 1919|in Hungary]] and [[German Revolution of 1918–19|in Germany]] (Ch IV); the conflict between Napoleon and Snowball (Ch V), parallelling &quot;the two rival and quasi-Messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another: [[Trotskyism]], with its faith in the [[Permanent revolution|revolutionary vocation]] of the proletariat of the West; and Stalinism with its glorification of [[socialism in one country|Russia's socialist destiny]]&quot;;{{sfn|Meyers |1975|p=138}} Napoleon's dealings with Whymper and the Willingdon markets (Ch VI), paralleling the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|Treaty of Rapallo]]; and Frederick's forged bank notes, parallelling the [[Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union|Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939]], after which Frederick attacks Animal Farm without warning and destroys the windmill.{{sfn|Meyers|1975 |p=141}}

The book's close, with the pigs and men in a kind of [[rapprochement]], reflected Orwell's view of the 1943 [[Tehran Conference]]{{efn|Preface to the Ukrainian edition of ''Animal Farm'', reprinted in Orwell:Collected Works, ''It Is What I Think'' |p= 89}} that seemed to display the establishment of &quot;the best possible relations between the USSR and the West&quot; – but in reality were destined, as Orwell presciently predicted, to continue to unravel.{{sfn|Leab |2007|p= 7 }} The disagreement between the allies and the start of the [[Cold War]] is suggested when Napoleon and Pilkington, both suspicious, &quot;played an ace of spades simultaneously&quot;.{{sfn|Meyers|1975 |p=142}}

Similarly, the music in the novel, starting with &quot;Beasts of England&quot; and the later anthems, parallels &quot;[[The Internationale]]&quot; and its adoption and repudiation by the Soviet authorities as the anthem of the USSR in the 1920s and 1930s.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

==Adaptations==
===Films===
''Animal Farm'' has been adapted to film twice. Both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties, including sanitising some aspects.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}
* [[Animal Farm (1954 film)|''Animal Farm'']] (1954) is an animated film, in which Napoleon is eventually overthrown in a second revolution. In 1974, [[E. Howard Hunt]] revealed that he had been sent by the [[CIA]]'s [[Psychological Warfare]] department to obtain the film rights from Orwell's widow, and the resulting 1954 animation was funded by the agency.{{sfn|Chilton|2016}}
* [[Animal Farm (1999 film)|''Animal Farm'']] (1999) is a live-action TV version that shows Napoleon's regime collapsing in on itself, with the farm having new human owners, reflecting the collapse of Soviet communism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

In 2012, an HFR-3D version of ''Animal Farm'', potentially directed by [[Andy Serkis]], was announced.{{sfn|Giardina|2012}}{{clarifyme|date=June 2020}}

===Radio dramatizations===
A BBC radio version, produced by [[Rayner Heppenstall]], was broadcast in January 1947. Orwell listened to the production at his home in Canonbury Square, London, with [[Hugh Gordon Porteus|Hugh Gordon Porteous]], amongst others. Orwell later wrote to Heppenstall that Porteous, &quot;who had not read the book, grasped what was happening after a few minutes.&quot;{{sfn|Orwell|2013|page=112}}

A further radio production, again using Orwell's own dramatisation of the book, was broadcast in January 2013 on BBC [[Radio Four|Radio 4]]. [[Tamsin Greig]] narrated, and the cast included [[Nicky Henson]] as Napoleon, [[Toby Jones]] as the propagandist Squealer, and [[Ralph Ineson]] as Boxer.{{sfn|Real George Orwell,}}

===Stage productions===
A theatrical version, with music by [[Richard Peaslee]] and lyrics by [[Adrian Mitchell]], was staged at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] London on 25 April 1984, directed by [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]]. It toured nine cities in 1985.{{sfn|Orwell|2013|page=341}}

A solo version, adapted and performed by Guy Masterson, premièred at the [[Traverse Theatre]] Edinburgh in January 1995 and has toured worldwide since.{{sfn|One man ''Animal|2013}}{{sfn|Animal Farm}}

===Comic strip===
[[File:Animal Farm strip cartoon.jpg|thumb|300px|Foreign Office copy of the first instalment of Norman Pett's ''Animal Farm'' comic strip.]]
In 1950 [[Norman Pett]] and his writing partner [[Don Freeman]] were secretly hired by the [[British Foreign Office]] to adapt ''Animal Farm'' into a comic strip. This comic was not published in the U.K. but ran in Brazilian and Burmese newspapers.{{sfn|Norman Pett}}

'''Amphibians''' are [[ectotherm]]ic, [[tetrapod]] [[vertebrate]]s of the [[Class (biology)|class]] '''Amphibia'''. Modern amphibians are all [[Lissamphibia]]. They inhabit a wide variety of [[habitat]]s, with most species living within [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[fossorial]], [[arboreal]] or freshwater [[aquatic ecosystems]]. Thus amphibians typically start out as [[larva]]e living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this.

The young generally undergo [[metamorphosis]] from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with [[lung]]s. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial [[salamander]]s and [[frog]]s lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to [[lizard]]s but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are [[amniote]]s and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often [[ecological indicator]]s; in recent decades there has been a dramatic [[decline in amphibian populations]] for many species around the globe.

The earliest amphibians [[evolution of tetrapods|evolved]] in the [[Devonian]] period from [[sarcopterygian]] fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass Lissamphibia.

The three modern orders of amphibians are [[Anura (frog)|Anura]] (the frogs and toads), [[Urodela]] (the salamanders), and [[caecilian|Apoda]] (the caecilians). The number of known amphibian species is approximately 8,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs. The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a frog from [[New Guinea]] (''[[Paedophryne amauensis]]'') with a length of just {{convert|7.7|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The largest living amphibian is the {{convert|1.8|m|0|abbr=on}} [[South China giant salamander]] (''Andrias sligoi''), but this is dwarfed by the extinct {{convert|9|m|0|abbr=on}} ''[[Prionosuchus]]'' from the [[Guadalupian|middle Permian]] of Brazil. The study of amphibians is called [[batrachology]], while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called [[herpetology]].

The word &quot;amphibian&quot; is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] term ἀμφίβιος (''amphíbios''), which means &quot;both kinds of life&quot;, ''ἀμφί'' meaning &quot;of both kinds&quot; and ''βιος'' meaning &quot;life&quot;. The term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water, including seals and otters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise Etymological Dictionary of the English Language |last=Skeat |first=Walter W. |year=1897 |publisher=Clarendon Press |page=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the class Amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes. Amphibia in its widest sense (''[[sensu lato]]'') was divided into three [[Class (biology)|subclasses]], two of which are extinct:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baird, Donald |date=May 1965 |title=Paleozoic lepospondyl amphibians |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=287–294 |doi=10.1093/icb/5.2.287 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed. The two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website AmphibiaWeb, [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the classification by [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] [[Darrel Frost]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]], available as the online reference database &quot;Amphibian Species of the World&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/ |title= American Museum of Natural History: Amphibian Species of the World 5.6, an Online Reference |author=Frost, Darrel |year=2013 |publisher=The American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of species cited above follows Frost and the total number of known amphibian species as of March 31, 2019 is exactly 8,000,&lt;ref&gt;http://amphibiaweb.org:8000/lists/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; of which nearly 90% are frogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;species&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Crump, Martha L. |year=2009 |title=Amphibian diversity and life history |journal=Amphibian Ecology and Conservation.

With the [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] classification, the taxon [[Labyrinthodontia]] has been discarded as it is a [[Paraphyly|polyparaphyletic]] group without unique defining features apart from [[Cladistics#plesiomorphy|shared primitive characteristics]]. Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a [[Cladistics#Three definitions of clade|stem-based or a node-based]] classification. Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage, while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia. The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain, and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups, like the Temnospondyli (traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia) or the Lepospondyli, and in some analyses even in the amniotes. This means that advocates of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] have removed a large number of [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] Devonian and Carboniferous amphibian-type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in Amphibia in [[Linnaean taxonomy]], and included them elsewhere under [[cladistic taxonomy]].&lt;ref name=BlackburnWake&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blackburn, D.

All modern amphibians are included in the subclass Lissamphibia, which is usually considered a [[clade]], a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor. The three modern orders are Anura (the frogs and toads), Caudata (or Urodela, the salamanders), and Gymnophiona (or Apoda, the caecilians).{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=3 }} It has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a Temnospondyl-like ancestor, and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced [[reptiliomorpha|reptiliomorph]] amphibians, and thus of amniotes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot; /&gt; Although the fossils of several older proto-frogs with primitive characteristics are known, the oldest &quot;true frog&quot; is ''[[Prosalirus bitis]]'', from the [[Early Jurassic]] [[Kayenta Formation]] of Arizona.

Authorities disagree as to whether Salientia is a superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. The Lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three [[Order (biology)|orders]], but an extinct salamander-like family, the [[Albanerpetontidae]], is now considered part of Lissamphibia alongside the superorder Salientia. Furthermore, Salientia includes all three recent orders plus the Triassic proto-frog, ''[[Triadobatrachus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Salientia/14938 |title=Salientia |author=Cannatella, David |year=2008 |work=Tree of Life Web Project |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major groups of amphibians developed in the [[Devonian]] period, around 370 million years ago, from [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fish]] which were similar to the modern [[coelacanth]] and [[lungfish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;evoamphib&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/evolution/AnimalEvolution.shtml#evolutionofamphibian |title=Evolution of amphibians |publisher=University of Waikato: Plant and animal evolution |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs that help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would [[evolution|evolve]] into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all [[tetrapod]]s, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and [[mammal]]s. Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric [[tetrapodomorph]] fish still spent most of their time in the water.

''[[Ichthyostega]]'' was one of the first primitive amphibians, with nostrils and more efficient lungs. It had four sturdy limbs, a neck, a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe-finned fish, ''[[Eusthenopteron]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;evoamphib&quot; /&gt; Amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods.

At the end of the Devonian period (360 million years ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates,&lt;ref name=&quot;Spoczynska&quot;/&gt; though some, such as ''Ichthyostega'', may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water.

Extensive swamps developed with [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s and [[calamites]]. Air-breathing [[arthropod]]s evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment. There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile. Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong tail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spoczynska&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Fossils: A Study in Evolution |last=Spoczynska |first=J.

They still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs, and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors. It was the development of the [[amniote|amniotic]] egg, which prevents the developing embryo from drying out, that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their [[Dominance (ecology)|dominance]] in the period that followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;evoamphib&quot;/&gt;

The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate. A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on [[Ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] analysis, suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs. It also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the [[Paleozoic]] or early [[Mesozoic]] (around 250 million years ago), before the breakup of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fish. The briefness of this period, and the swiftness with which radiation took place, would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=San Mauro, Diego |author2=Vences, Miguel |author3=Alcobendas, Marina |author4=Zardoya, Rafael |author5=Meyer, Axel |year=2005 |title=Initial diversification of living amphibians predated the breakup of Pangaea |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=165 |issue=5 |pages=590–599 |doi=10.1086/429523 |pmid=15795855 |url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-33053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are large gaps in the [[fossil record]], but the discovery of a [[Gerobatrachus hottoni]] from the Early Permian in Texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anderson, J. |author2=Reisz, R. |author3=Scott, D. |author4=Fröbisch, N. |author5=Sumida, S. |year=2008 |title=A stem batrachian from the Early Permian of Texas and the origin of frogs and salamanders |journal=Nature |volume=453 |issue= 7194|pages=515–518 |doi=10.1038/nature06865 |pmid= 18497824 |bibcode = 2008Natur.453..515A |url=https://www.academia.edu/13288317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular analysis]] suggests that the frog–salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the [[Paleontology|palaeontological]] evidence indicates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot; /&gt; Newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all Lissamphibians lived about 315 million years ago, and that [[Stereospondyli|stereospondyls]] are the closest relatives to the caecilians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170619151534.htm Tiny fossils reveal backstory of the most mysterious amphibian alive]&lt;/ref&gt;

As they evolved from lunged fish, amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land, including the need to develop new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their [[lateral line]] systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful [[ultraviolet]] rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=843–859 }}

Modern amphibians have a simplified anatomy compared to their ancestors due to [[Neoteny|paedomorphosis]], caused by two evolutionary trends: miniaturization and an unusually large genome, which result in a slower growth and development rate compared to other vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.no/books?id=eDKEKy5JJbIC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22This+is+related+to+two+evolutionary+trends+in+amphibians%22&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJzuaj0ozqAhXRmIsKHZs0C3kQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22This%20is%20related%20to%20two%20evolutionary%20trends%20in%20amphibians%22&amp;f=false The Ecology and Behavior of Amphibians]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4691792/ Biological Scaling Problems and Solutions in Amphibians - NCBI]&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for their size is associated with their rapid metamorphosis, which seems to have evolved only in the ancestors of lissamphibia; in all other known lines the development was much more gradual. Because a remodeling of the feeding apparatus means they don't eat during the metamorphosis, the metamorphosis has to go faster the smaller the individual is, so it happens at an early stage when the larvae are still small.

Amphibians are ectothermic (cold-blooded) vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal [[Physiology|physiological]] processes. Their [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]] is low and as a result, their food and energy requirements are limited. In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern amphibians have fully [[Ossification|ossified]] vertebrae with [[articular processes]]. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little [[keratin]] and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many [[mucous gland]]s and in some species, [[Skin|poison glands]] (a type of granular gland). The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two [[atrium (heart)|atria]] and one [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. They have a [[urinary bladder]] and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as [[urea]]. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults. Amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the [[Buccopharyngeal membrane|buccopharyngeal]] region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=24–25 }} They supplement this with [[gas exchange]] through the skin.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=843–859 }}

[[File:Triturus dobrogicus dunai tarajosgőte.jpg|thumb|alt=Danube crested newt|[[Danube crested newt]] &lt;br&gt;(''Triturus dobrogicus''), an advanced salamander]]

The suborder [[Cryptobranchoidea]] contains the primitive salamanders. A number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found, but there are only three living species, the Chinese giant salamander (''Andrias davidianus''), the [[Japanese giant salamander]] (''Andrias japonicus'') and the [[hellbender]] (''Cryptobranchus alleganiensis'') from North America. These large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded. A unique feature is their ability to feed by suction, depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADWCrypto&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Cryptobranchidae.html | title=Cryptobranchidae | author=Heying, Heather | year=2003 | work=Animal Diversity Web | publisher=University of Michigan | accessdate=August 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The males excavate nests, persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them, and guard them. As well as breathing with lungs, they respire through the many folds in their thin skin, which has [[Capillary|capillaries]] close to the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;EHSAR&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/es/soc/amphibians/eahe-sa.pdf | title=Eastern Hellbender Status Assessment Report |author1=Mayasich, J. |author2=Grandmaison, D. |author3=Phillips, C. | date=June 1, 2003 | publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service | accessdate=August 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suborder [[Salamandroidea]] contains the advanced salamanders. They differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused [[Mandible|prearticular bones]] in the lower jaw, and by using internal fertilisation. In salamandrids, the male deposits a bundle of sperm, the [[spermatophore]], and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid.&lt;ref name=&quot;BritCaudata&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100353/Caudata |title=Caudata |author=Wake, David B |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest family in this group is Plethodontidae, the lungless salamanders, which includes 60% of all salamander species. The [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Salamandridae]] includes the true salamanders and the name &quot;[[newt]]&quot; is given to members of its subfamily [[Pleurodelinae]].{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=3 }}

The third suborder, [[Sirenoidea]], contains the four species of sirens, which are in a single family, [[Sirenidae]]. Members of this order are [[eel]]-like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs. Some of their features are primitive while others are derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cogger, H. G. |editor=Zweifel, R.

Despite this, the eggs are laid singly, a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;BritCaudata&quot; /&gt;

=== Gymnophiona ===
[[File:Siphonops paulensis02.jpg|thumb|alt=''Siphonops paulensis''|The limbless South American caecilian ''[[Siphonops paulensis]]'']]
The order [[Gymnophiona]] (from the Greek ''gymnos'' meaning &quot;naked&quot; and ''ophis'' meaning &quot;serpent&quot;) or Apoda comprises the caecilians. These are long, cylindrical, limbless animals with a snake- or [[Annelid|worm-like]] form. The adults vary in length from 8 to 75 centimetres (3 to 30 inches) with the exception of [[Caecilia thompsoni|Thomson's caecilian]] (''Caecilia thompsoni''), which can reach {{convert|150|cm|ft|abbr=off}}. A caecilian's skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales. It has rudimentary eyes covered in skin, which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity. It also has a pair of short [[tentacle]]s near the eye that can be extended and which have [[Somatosensory system|tactile]] and [[Olfaction|olfactory]] functions. Most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil, in rotten wood and under plant debris, but some are aquatic.{{sfn| Stebbins| Cohen | 1995 | p=4}} Most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch, they make their way to adjacent bodies of water. Others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch. A few species give birth to live young, nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=858}} Caecilians have a mostly [[Gondwana]]n distribution, being found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia and Central and South America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29797/Gymnophiona |title=Gymnophiona |author=Duellman, William E. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anatomy and physiology ==

=== Skin ===
[[File:Tree frog congo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Common reed frog|The [[Aposematism|bright colours]] of the [[common reed frog]] (''Hyperolius viridiflavus'') are typical of a toxic species]]
The [[Wikt:integument|integumentary]] structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates, such as the presence of highly [[Keratin#Cornification|cornified]] outer layers, renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the [[pituitary gland|pituitary]] and [[thyroid]] glands. Local thickenings (often called warts) are common, such as those found on toads. The outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece, in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes. Amphibians often eat the sloughed skin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt; Caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the [[dermis]] between the furrows in the skin. The similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial. [[Squamata|Lizards]] and some frogs have somewhat similar [[osteoderm]]s forming bony deposits in the dermis, but this is an example of [[convergent evolution]] with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zylberberg, Louise |author2=Wake, Marvalee H. |year=1990 |title=Structure of the scales of ''Dermophis'' and ''Microcaecilia'' (Amphibia: Gymnophiona), and a comparison to dermal ossifications of other vertebrates |journal=Journal of Morphology |volume=206 |issue=1 |pages=25–43 |doi=10.1002/jmor.1052060104 |pmid=29865751 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227806326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphibian skin is permeable to water. Gas exchange can take place through the skin ([[cutaneous respiration]]) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt; To compensate for their thin and delicate skin, amphibians have evolved mucous glands, principally on their heads, backs and tails. The secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist. In addition, most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances. Some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;amphibfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Amphibian_morphology_and_reproduction |title=Amphibian morphology and reproduction |date=October 12, 2008 |authors=Biodiversity Institute of Ontario; Hebert, Paul D. N. |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Earth |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main poison-producing glands, the [[Parotoid gland|parotoids]], produce the neurotoxin [[bufotoxin]] and are located behind the ears of toads, along the backs of frogs, behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=10–11 }}

The skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called [[chromatophore]]s. These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by [[hormone]]s secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Integument: A Textbook of Skin Biology |last=Spearman |first=R.

=== Skeletal system and locomotion ===
Amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to other tetrapods, though with a number of variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully [[ossification|ossified]] and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The [[pectoral girdle]] is supported by muscle, and the well-developed [[pelvic girdle]] is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }}

[[File:Ceratophrys cornuta skeleton front.jpg|thumb|alt=Frog skeleton|Skeleton of the [[Surinam horned frog]]&lt;br&gt;(''Ceratophrys cornuta'')]]
In most amphibians, there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some salamanders have fewer digits and the [[amphiuma]]s are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. The [[Siren (genus)|sirens]] are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=26–36 }}

In frogs, the hind legs are larger than the fore legs, especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} Some salamanders in the genus ''[[Aneides]]'' and certain [[lungless salamander|plethodontids]] climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails.&lt;ref name=&quot;BritCaudata&quot; /&gt; In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[ventral fin|ventral]] fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=26–36 }}

Salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as [[autotomy]]. Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily. The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape. Both tails and limbs can be regenerated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beneski&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Beneski, John T. Jr. | date=September 1989 | title=Adaptive significance of tail autotomy in the salamander, ''Ensatina'' | journal=Journal of Herpetology | volume=23 | issue=3 | pages=322–324 | doi=10.2307/1564465 | jstor=1564465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=26–36 }}

=== Circulatory system ===
[[File:Didactic model of an amphibian heart-FMVZ USP-14.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|[[Educational toy|Didactic model]] of an amphibian heart.]]
[[File:Juvenile Amphibian Circulatory System.svg|thumb|Juvenile amphibian circulatory systems are single loop systems which resemble fish.&lt;br&gt; 1 – Internal gills where the blood is reoxygenated&lt;br&gt;2 – Point where the blood is depleted of oxygen and returns to the heart via veins&lt;br&gt;3 – Two chambered heart.&lt;br&gt;Red indicates oxygenated blood, and blue represents oxygen depleted blood.]]
Amphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation is similar to that of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the [[pulmonary artery]] to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=306 }}

=== Nervous and sensory systems ===
The [[nervous system]] is basically the same as in other vertebrates, with a central brain, a spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body. The amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles, birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish. It is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving [[Pain in amphibians|pain]].  The brain consists of equal parts, [[cerebrum]], [[midbrain]] and [[cerebellum]]. Various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input, such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe, and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning. The cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination and the [[medulla oblongata]] controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration. The brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body. The [[pineal body]], known to regulate sleep patterns in humans, is thought to produce the hormones involved in [[hibernation]] and [[aestivation]] in amphibians.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=100 }}

Tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes, but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians. Some caecilians possess [[Electroreception|electroreceptors]] that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water. The ears are well developed in frogs. There is no external ear, but the large circular [[Tympanum (anatomy)|eardrum]] lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye. This vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone, the [[stapes]], to the inner ear. Only high-frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way, but low-frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} There is a patch of specialized haircells, called ''papilla amphibiorum'', in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds. Another feature, unique to frogs and salamanders, is the columella-operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=69 }} The ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAmphibia&quot; /&gt;

The eyes of tadpoles lack lids, but at metamorphosis, the [[cornea]] becomes more dome-shaped, the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] becomes flatter, and [[eyelid]]s and associated glands and ducts develop.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes. They allow colour vision and depth of focus. In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAmphibia&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/21445/amphibian/ |title=Amphibian |author1=Duellman, William E. |author2=Zug, George R. |year=2012 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digestive and excretory systems ===
[[File:Frog anatomy tags.PNG|thumb|alt=Dissected frog|Dissected frog: 1&amp;nbsp;Right&amp;nbsp;atrium, 2&amp;nbsp;Liver, 3&amp;nbsp;Aorta, 4&amp;nbsp;Egg mass, 5&amp;nbsp;Colon, 6&amp;nbsp;Left&amp;nbsp;atrium, 7&amp;nbsp;Ventricle, 8&amp;nbsp;Stomach, 9&amp;nbsp;Left lung, 10&amp;nbsp;Spleen, 11&amp;nbsp;Small&amp;nbsp;intestine, 12&amp;nbsp;Cloaca]]
Many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by [[inertia]]. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short [[Esophagus|oesophagus]] is lined with [[Cilium|cilia]] that help to move the food to the stomach and [[mucus]] produced by glands in the mouth and [[pharynx]] eases its passage. The enzyme [[chitinase]] produced in the stomach helps digest the [[chitin]]ous cuticle of arthropod prey.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }}

Amphibians possess a [[pancreas]], [[liver]] and [[gall bladder]]. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is determined by its function as a [[glycogen]] and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. [[Adipose tissue]] is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=66 }}
&lt;!--In aquatic amphibians, the liver plays only a small role in processing nitrogen for excretion, and [[ammonia]] is diffused mainly through the skin. The liver of terrestrial amphibians converts ammonia to urea, a less toxic, water-soluble nitrogenous compound, as a means of water conservation. In some species, urea is further converted into [[uric acid]]. [[Bile]] secretions from the liver collect in the gall bladder and flow into the small intestine. In the small intestine, enzymes digest carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Salamanders lack a valve separating the small intestine from the large intestine. Salt and water absorption occur in the large intestine, as well as mucous secretion to aid in the transport of faecal matter, which is passed out through the [[cloaca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Anatomy&quot; /&gt;---Omitting this until a more reliable source can be found.---&gt;

There are two [[kidney]]s located dorsally, near the roof of the body cavity. Their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less toxic product urea. Some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=849 }}

=== Respiratory system ===
[[File:Axolotl ganz.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Axolotl|The [[axolotl]] (''Ambystoma mexicanum'') retains its larval form with gills into adulthood]]
The lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes, possessing few internal [[alveolar septum|septa]] and large [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood. Ventilation is accomplished by [[buccal pumping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brainerd|first1=E. L. |title=New perspectives on the evolution of lung ventilation mechanisms in vertebrates |journal=Experimental Biology Online |year=1999 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1007/s00898-999-0002-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most amphibians, however, are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin. To enable sufficient [[cutaneous respiration]], the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }} Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the [[Telmatobius culeus|Titicaca water frog]] and the [[Cryptobranchus|hellbender salamander]]. In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the [[Plethodontidae|plethodontid salamanders]], which have neither lungs nor gills. Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the [[axolotl]]) retaining gills as aquatic adults.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }}

== Reproduction ==
{{see also|Sexual selection in amphibians}}
[[File:Litoria xanthomera amplexus.jpg|thumb|alt=Orange-thighed frogs in amplexus|Male [[orange-thighed frog]] (''Litoria xanthomera'') grasping the female during [[amplexus]]]]
For the purpose of [[Biological reproduction|reproduction]] most amphibians require [[fresh water]] although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. ''[[Fejervarya raja]]'') can inhabit brackish water, but there are no true [[marine (ocean)|marine]] amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hopkins Gareth R. |author2=Brodie Edmund D., Jr | year = 2015 | title = Occurrence of Amphibians in Saline Habitats: A Review and Evolutionary Perspective | journal = Herpetological Monographs | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 1–27 | doi = 10.1655/HERPMONOGRAPHS-D-14-00006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such was the case with the [[Black Sea]] invasion of the natural hybrid ''[[Pelophylax esculentus]]'' reported in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Natchev, Nikolay |author2=Tzankov, Nikolay |author3=Geme, Richard |year=2011 |title=Green frog invasion in the Black Sea: habitat ecology of the ''Pelophylax esculentus'' complex (Anura, Amphibia) population in the region of Shablenska Тuzla lagoon in Bulgaria |journal=Herpetology Notes |volume=4 |pages=347–351 |url=http://www.herpetologynotes.seh-herpetology.org/Volume4_PDFs/Natchev_et_al_Herpetology_Notes_Volume4_pages347-351.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several hundred frog species in [[adaptive radiation]]s (e.g., ''[[Eleutherodactylus]]'', the Pacific ''[[Platymantis]]'', the Australo-Papuan [[microhylid]]s, and many other tropical frogs), however, do not need any water for [[breeding in the wild]]. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical rainforests]] and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, passing through the [[tadpole]] stage within the egg. Reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall, but the seasonal timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |title=Abiotic factor |author=Hogan, C. Michael |date=July 31, 2010 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Earth |publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment |accessdate=September 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608071757/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |archivedate=June 8, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tropics, many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year. In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=140–141 }}

In caecilians, fertilisation is internal, the male extruding an [[intromittent organ]], the phallodeum, and inserting it into the female cloaca. The paired Müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian [[prostate]] glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm. Fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duellman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology of Amphibians |last=Duellman|first=Willia E. |author2= Trueb, Linda |year=1994 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-4780-6 |pages=77–79 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CzxVvKmrtIgC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=phallodeum#v=onepage&amp;q=phallodeum&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation. In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone, on the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent. The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called [[amplexus]]. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, [[Hynobiidae]] and [[Cryptobranchidae]] practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duellman&quot; /&gt;

With a few exceptions, frogs use external fertilisation. The male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs, or in the case of ''[[Epipedobates tricolor]]'', around the neck. They remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm. Roughened nuptial pads on the male's hands aid in retaining grip. Often the male collects and retains the egg mass, forming a sort of basket with the hind feet. An exception is the [[granular poison frog]] (''Oophaga granulifera'') where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously. The [[tailed frog]] (''Ascaphus truei'') exhibits internal fertilisation. The &quot;tail&quot; is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female. This frog lives in fast-flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=154–162 }} The sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the [[oviduct]] until the following spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ascaphus&amp;where-species=truei |title=''Ascaphus truei'' |author1=Adams, Michael J. |author2=Pearl, Christopher A. |year=2005 |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders. Typically, prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site, the males usually arriving first, calling and setting up territories. Other satellite males remain quietly nearby, waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory. The females arrive sporadically, mate selection takes place and eggs are laid. The females depart and territories may change hands. More females appear and in due course, the breeding season comes to an end. Explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall. These frogs are typically [[wikt:fossorial|fossorial]] species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site. They are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place, perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season. The assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues, the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=154–162 }}

[[File:Plethodon cinereus.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|Sexual selection has been studied in the [[red back salamander]]]]
&lt;!--[[Sexual selection]] typically manifests as male-male competition where males will arrive at the waters edge first in large number, producing a wide range of vocalizations and other complex behaviours to attract mates, with the [[fitness (biology)|fittest]] males having the deepest croaks and the best territories. It also exists as [[mate choice]], with females known to choose a mate, at least partly based on the male's depth of croaking. This has led to [[sexual dimorphism]], with females being larger than males in 90% of species, males larger in 10% of species and males fighting for groups of females.--&gt;

There is a direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts, with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female's attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to [[mating|mate]] with.&lt;ref name=romano&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romano|first=Antonio|author2=Bruni, Giacomo |title=Courtship behaviour, mating season and male sexual interference in ''Salamandrina perspicillata''|journal=Amphibia-Reptilia|year=2011|volume=32|issue=1|pages=63–76|doi=10.1163/017353710X541878|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species store [[sperm]] through long breeding seasons, as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Erika M.|author2=Jones, A.

== Life cycle ==
Most amphibians go through [[metamorphosis]], a process of significant morphological change after birth. In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by [[thyroxine]] concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and [[prolactin]], which counteracts thyroxine's effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Kikuyama | first1 = Sakae

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth, whisker-like skin extensions or fins. They also make use of a sensory lateral line organ similar to that of fish. After metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death, called [[apoptosis]]. The variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide, with many discoveries still being made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Newman, Robert A. |year=1992 |title=Adaptive plasticity in amphibian metamorphosis |journal=BioScience |volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=671–678 |doi= 10.2307/1312173 |jstor=1312173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eggs ===
[[File:Frogspawn closeup.jpg|thumb|alt=Frogspawn|Frogspawn, a mass of eggs surrounded by jelly]]

The egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing [[mucoprotein]]s and [[mucopolysaccharide]]s. This capsule is permeable to water and gases, and swells considerably as it absorbs water. The ovum is at first rigidly held, but in fertilised eggs the innermost layer liquefies and allows the [[embryo]] to move freely. This also happens in salamander eggs, even when they are unfertilised. Eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae. These penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis. They seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gilbert, Perry W. |year=1942 |title=Observations on the eggs of ''Ambystoma maculatum'' with especial reference to the green algae found within the egg envelopes |journal=Ecology |volume=23 |pages=215–227 |jstor=1931088 |doi=10.2307/1931088 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most eggs contain the pigment [[melanin]] which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against [[ultraviolet radiation]]. Caecilians, some [[plethodontid]] salamanders and certain frogs lay eggs underground that are unpigmented. In the [[wood frog]] (''Rana sylvatica''), the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to {{convert|6|C-change|F-change}} warmer than its surroundings, which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Waldman, Bruce |author2=Ryan, Michael J. |year=1983 |title=Thermal advantages of communal egg mass deposition in wood frogs (''Rana sylvatica'') |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=70–72 |jstor=1563783 |doi=10.2307/1563783|url=https://www.academia.edu/14057397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups, or may take the form of spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings. In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams. The amphibious salamander ''[[Ensatina]]'' attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots. The [[Eleutherodactylus planirostris|greenhouse frog]] (''Eleutherodactylus planirostris'') lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_search_index&amp;where-genus=Eleutherodactylus&amp;where-species=planirostris |title=''Eleutherodactylus planirostris'' |author=Meshaka, Walter E. Jr |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tungara frog]] (''Physalaemus pustulosus'') builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs. First a raft is built, then eggs are laid in the centre, and finally a foam cap is overlaid. The foam has anti-microbial properties. It contains no [[detergent]]s but is created by whipping up [[protein]]s and [[lectin]]s secreted by the female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dalgetty, Laura |author2=Kennedy, Malcolm W. |year=2010 |title=Building a home from foam: túngara frog foam nest architecture and three-phase construction process |journal=Biology Letters |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=293–296 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0934 |pmid=20106853 |pmc=2880057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/lifesciences/staff/malcolmkennedy/malcolmkennedy/proteinsoffrogfoamnests/ |title=Proteins of frog foam nests |publisher=School of Life Sciences, University of Glasgow |accessdate=August 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Larvae ===
[[File:Frog spawn time-lapse.gif|thumb|left|alt=Frog spawn development|Early stages in the development of the embryos of the [[common frog]] (''Rana temporaria'')]]
The eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free-living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults. In many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae), direct development takes place, the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults. Many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land, and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies. Some caecilians, the [[alpine salamander]] (''Salamandra atra'') and some of the [[Nectophrynoides|African live-bearing toads]] (''Nectophrynoides spp.'') are [[Viviparity|viviparous]]. Their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female's oviduct, often for long periods. Other amphibians, but not caecilians, are [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]]. The eggs are retained in or on the parent's body, but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult. The larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth, either before or after metamorphosis, according to their species.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=6–9 }} The toad genus ''Nectophrynoides'' exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members.&lt;ref name=&quot;species&quot;/&gt;

==== Frogs ====
Frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails with fins. The free-living larvae are normally fully aquatic, but the tadpoles of some species (such as ''[[Nannophrys ceylonensis]]'') are semi-terrestrial and live among wet rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_lists_genera_&amp;table=amphib&amp;where-genus=Nannophrys&amp;where-species=ceylonensis |title=''Nannophrys ceylonensis'' |author=Janzen, Peter |date=May 10, 2005 |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), [[lateral line system]]s and large tails that they use for swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-40603/Anura |title=Anura: From tadpole to adult |author1=Duellman, W. E. |author2=Zug, G. R. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills. The lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs, the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air. Some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. These larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place. While tadpoles do not have true teeth, in most species, the jaws have long, parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=179–181 }} Front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later.

Iodine and T4 (over stimulate the spectacular [[apoptosis]] [programmed cell death] of the cells of the larval gills, tail and fins) also stimulate the [[evolution of nervous systems]] transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial, carnivorous frog with better neurological, visuospatial, olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine|journal=Current Chemical Biology|volume=5 |pages=155–162|year=2011|issn=1872-3136|doi=10.2174/187231311796765012|issue=3|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272210714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Iodine, PUFAs and Iodolipids in Health and Disease: An Evolutionary Perspective|journal=Human Evolution-|volume= 29 |issue= 1–3|pages=185–205|year=2014|issn=0393-9375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, tadpoles developing in ponds and streams are typically [[herbivore|herbivorous]]. Pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies, large caudal fins and small mouths; they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation. Stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths, shallow bodies and caudal fins; they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of [[algae]] and bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAnura&quot;/&gt; They also feed on [[diatom]]s, filtered from the water through the [[gill]]s, and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond, ingesting edible fragments. They have a relatively long, spiral-shaped gut to enable them to digest this diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAnura&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29023/Anura |title=Anura |author1=Duellman, William E. |author2=Zug, George R. |year=2012 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles and fish. Young of the [[Cuban tree frog]] (''Osteopilus septentrionalis'') can occasionally be [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalistic]], the younger tadpoles attacking a larger, more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crump, Martha L. |year=1986 |title=Cannibalism by younger tadpoles: another hazard of metamorphosis |journal=Copeia |volume=1986 |pages=1007–1009 |jstor=1445301 |doi=10.2307/1445301 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Bufobufotadpoles.jpg|800px|alt=Metamorphosis|Successive stages in the development of [[common toad]] (''Bufo bufo'') tadpoles, finishing with metamorphosis}}
At metamorphosis, rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a large jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, and a tongue is formed. There are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system. All this can happen in about a day. A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAnura&quot; /&gt;

==== Salamanders ====
[[File:Ambystoma macrodactylum 26597.JPG|thumb|alt=Larva of the long-toed salamander|Larva of the [[long-toed salamander]] &lt;br&gt;(''Ambystoma macrodactylum'')]]

[[File:Mesotriton alpestris apuanus04.jpg|thumb|alt=Larvae of the alpine newt|Larvae of the [[alpine newt]] &lt;br&gt;(''Ichthyosaura alpestris'')]]
At hatching, a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids, teeth in both upper and lower jaws, three pairs of feathery external gills, a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] and [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] fins. The forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond-living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water. Pond-type larvae often have a pair of balancers, rod-like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment. Some members of the genera ''[[Ambystoma]]'' and ''[[Dicamptodon]]'' have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form, but this varies with species and with populations. The [[northwestern salamander]] (''Ambystoma gracile'') is one of these and, depending on environmental factors, either remains permanently in the larval state, a condition known as [[neoteny]], or transforms into an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Valentine, Barry D. |author2=Dennis, David M. | year=1964 | title=A comparison of the gill-arch system and fins of three genera of larval salamanders, ''Rhyacotriton'', ''Gyrinophilus'', and ''Ambystoma'' | journal=Copeia | volume=1964 | issue=1 | pages=196–201 | jstor=1440850 | doi=10.2307/1440850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are able to breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?where-genus=Ambystoma&amp;where-species=gracile |title=''Ambystoma gracile'' |author=Shaffer, H. Bradley |year=2005 |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoteny occurs when the animal's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/titus/herp_old/neoteny.htm |title=Metamorphosis vs. neoteny (paedomorphosis) in salamanders (Caudata) |author=Kiyonaga, Robin R |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food, lack of trace elements and competition from [[conspecific]]s. The [[tiger salamander]] (''Ambystoma tigrinum'') also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process. The adult tiger salamander is terrestrial, but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state. When conditions are particularly inhospitable on land, larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out. There are fifteen species of [[wikt:obligate|obligate]] neotenic salamanders, including species of ''[[Necturus]]'', ''[[Olm|Proteus]]'' and ''Amphiuma'', and many examples of [[wikt:facultative|facultative]] ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology of Amphibians |last=Duellman |first=William E. |author2=Trueb, Linda |year=1994 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-4780-6 |pages=191–192 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CzxVvKmrtIgC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=salamander+obligate+neoteny#v=onepage&amp;q=salamander%20obligate%20neoteny&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lungless salamanders in the family Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the eggs. In the genus ''[[Ensatinas]]'', the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=196 }}

In newts and salamanders, metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs. This is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. Their lungs are functional early, but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure. Salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shaffer, H. Bradley |author2=Austin, C. C. |author3=Huey, R. B. |year=1991 |title=The consequences of metamorphosis on salamander (''Ambystoma'') locomotor performance |journal=Physiological Zoology |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=212–231 |jstor=30158520 |doi=10.1086/physzool.64.1.30158520 |url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/35a9/f72917535be00155ac93824e53b1876583da.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxine. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100353/Caudata |title=Caudata |author=Wake, David B. |year=2012 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Caecilians ====
[[File:CaecilianNHM.png|thumb|left|alt=''Ichthyophis glutinosus''|The caecilian ''Ichthyophis glutinosus'' with eggs and developing embryo]]
Most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water. The development of the young of ''[[Ichthyophis glutinosus]]'', a species from Sri Lanka, has been much studied. The eel-like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water. They have three pairs of external red feathery gills, a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes, a lateral line system and a short tail with fins. They swim by undulating their body from side to side. They are mostly active at night, soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land. Metamorphosis is gradual. By the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes, lateral line systems and tails. The skin thickens, embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments. By this time, the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Breckenridge, W. R. |author2=Nathanael, S. |author3=Pereira, L. |year=1987 |title=Some aspects of the biology and development of ''Ichthyophis glutinosus'' |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=211 |issue=3 |pages=437–449 |doi=10.1111/jzo.1987.211.3.437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siphonops annulatus.jpg|thumb|alt=Ringed caecilian|The [[Siphonops annulatus|ringed caecilian]] (''Siphonops annulatus'') resembles an earthworm]]
In the majority of species of caecilians, the young are produced by viviparity. ''[[Typhlonectes compressicauda]]'', a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in [[lipid]]s and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths as long as their mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wake, Marvalee H. |year=1977 |title=Fetal maintenance and its evolutionary significance in the Amphibia: Gymnophiona |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=379–386 |jstor=1562719 |doi=10.2307/1562719 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265101247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29797/Gymnophiona |title=Gymnophiona |author=Duellman, William E. |year=2012 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ringed caecilian (''[[Siphonops annulatus]]'') has developed a unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction. The progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy. The brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate. Meanwhile, they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wilkinson, Mark |author2=Kupfer, Alexander |author3=Marques-Porto, Rafael |author4=Jeffkins, Hilary |author5=Antoniazzi, Marta M. |author6=Jared, Carlos |year=2008 |title= One hundred million years of skin feeding?

=== Parental care ===
[[File:Panama Poison Dart Frog Colostethus panamensis with tadpoles.jpg|thumb|alt=Common rocket frog|Male [[common rocket frog]] (''Colostethus panamensis'') carrying tadpoles on his back]]

The care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place. Nevertheless, it is estimated that in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crump| first=Martha L.| year=1996| chapter=Parental care among the Amphibia| volume=25| pages=109–144| doi=10.1016/S0065-3454(08)60331-9 | series=Advances in the Study of Behavior| isbn=978-0-12-004525-9| title=Parental Care: Evolution, Mechanisms, and Adaptive Significance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1086/650727 | last1=Brown | first1=J.

Many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land. The [[black mountain salamander]] (''Desmognathus welteri'') does this, the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs. When fully developed, they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=853–854 }} The male hellbender, a primitive salamander, excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there. The male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch, using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen.&lt;ref name=&quot;EHSAR&quot; /&gt;

== Feeding and diet ==
[[File:Pacific brown salamander eating a worm.jpg|thumb|alt=Northwestern salamander|[[Northwestern salamander]] &lt;br&gt;(''Ambystoma gracile'') eating a worm]]
With a few exceptions, adult amphibians are [[Predation|predators]], feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow. The diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles, caterpillars, earthworms and spiders. The sirens (''[[Siren (genus)|Siren spp.]]'') often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Siren_intermedia.html |title=''Siren intermedia'': Lesser Siren |author=Gabbard, Jesse |year=2000 |work=Animal Diversity Web |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Brazilian tree frog (''[[Xenohyla truncata]]'') includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Da Silva, H. R. |author2=De Britto-Pereira, M. C. |year=2006 |title=How much fruit do fruit-eating frogs eat?

It projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first, their tongues being hinged at the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Trueb, Linda |author2=Gans, Carl |year=1983 |title=Feeding specializations of the Mexican burrowing toad, ''Rhinophrynus dorsalis'' (Anura: Rhinophrynidae) |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=199 |issue=2 |pages=189–208 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1983.tb02090.x |url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/74489/1/j.1469-7998.1983.tb02090.x.pdf |hdl=2027.42/74489 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food is mostly selected by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and [[Rana clamitans|green frogs]] (''Rana clamitans'') have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hamilton, W. J. Jr. |year=1948 |title=The food and feeding behavior of the green frog, ''Rana clamitans'' Latreille, in New York State |journal=Copeia |volume=1948 |issue=3 |pages=203–207 |publisher=American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists |jstor=1438455 |doi=10.2307/1438455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=56 }}

Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt; They typically have small hinged [[pedicellate teeth]], a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown of these are composed of [[dentine]] separated by an [[Calcification|uncalcified]] layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (''Rana spp.'') lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (''Bufo spp.'') have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also [[vomerine teeth]] attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=57–58 }}

The [[tiger salamander]] (''Ambystoma tigrinum'') is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates. Others amphibians, such as the ''Bufo spp.'' toads, actively search for prey, while the [[Argentine horned frog]] (''Ceratophrys ornata'') lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Radcliffe, Charles W. |author2=Chiszar, David |author3=Estep, Karen |author4=Murphy, James B. |author5=Smith, Hobart M. |year=1986 |title=Observations on pedal luring and pedal movements in Leptodactylid frogs |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=300–306 |jstor=1564496 |doi=10.2307/1564496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among leaf litter frogs in Panama, frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim, often brightly coloured and toxic, while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well-camouflaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Toft, Catherine A. |year=1981 |title=Feeding ecology of Panamanian litter anurans: patterns in diet and foraging mode |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=139–144 |jstor=1563372 |doi=10.2307/1563372 |url=https://www.academia.edu/364846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caecilians do not flick their tongues, but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward-pointing teeth. The struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow. The subdued prey is gulped down whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bemis, W. E. |author2=Schwenk, K. |author3=Wake, M.

When they are newly hatched, frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg. When this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria, algal crusts, detritus and raspings from submerged plants. Water is drawn in through their mouths, which are usually at the bottom of their heads, and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out. Others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth. They scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment, filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths. Some, such as the spadefoot toads, have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=181–185 }}

== Vocalization ==
[[File:Dendropsophus microcephalus - calling male (Cope, 1886).jpg|thumb|alt=Male treefrog calling|Male treefrog (''[[Dendropsophus microcephalus]]'') inflating his air sac as he calls]]
The calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks, grunts or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a form of communication. Most salamanders are considered voiceless, but the [[California giant salamander]] (''Dicamptodon ensatus'') has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound. Some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=76–77 }}

[[File:American Toad singing.jpg|thumb|American toad, (''[[Anaxyrus americanus]]'') singing]]
Frogs are much more vocal, especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an [[Gular skin|air sac]] or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=76–77 }} The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sullivan, Brian K. |year=1992 |title=Sexual selection and calling behavior in the American toad (''Bufo americanus'') |journal=Copeia |volume=1992 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |jstor=1446530 |doi=10.2307/1446530 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |chapter=Capitulo 4 |title=When frogs scream!

== Territorial behaviour ==
Little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians, but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges. These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites. Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved. Although in many frog species, females are larger than males, this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence. Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest, arms or thumbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shine, Richard |year=1979 |title=Sexual selection and sexual dimorphism in the Amphibia |journal=Copeia |volume=1979 |issue=2 |pages=297–306 |jstor=1443418 |doi=10.2307/1443418 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Redback salamander.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Red-backed salamander|The red back salamander (''[[Plethodon cinereus]]'') defends a territory against intruders.]]
In salamanders, defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder. This may involve snapping, chasing and sometimes biting, occasionally causing the loss of a tail. The behaviour of [[red back salamander]]s (''Plethodon cinereus'') has been much studied. 91% of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within a metre (yard) of their original daytime retreat under a log or rock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gergits&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gergits, W. F. |author2=Jaeger, R. G. | year=1990 | title=Site attachment by the red-backed salamander, ''Plethodon cinereus'' | journal=Journal of Herpetology | volume=24 | issue=1 | pages=91–93 | jstor=1564297 | doi=10.2307/1564297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar proportion, when moved experimentally a distance of {{convert|30|m}}, found their way back to their home base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gergits&quot;/&gt; The salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged {{convert|0.16|to|0.33|m2}} in size and were sometimes inhabited by a male and female pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_search_index&amp;where-genus=Plethodon&amp;where-species=cinereus&amp;rel-genus=equals&amp;rel-species=equals|title=''Plethodon cinereus'' |author=Casper, Gary S |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas. Much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals. An aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively. If the intruder persisted, a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso-labial grooves. Damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival, either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gergits&quot; /&gt;

In frogs, male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations; calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates. In general, a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual, and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males. Much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires. There is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders. Holders of territories have a &quot;home advantage&quot; and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar-sized frogs. If threats are insufficient, chest to chest tussles may take place. Fighting methods include pushing and shoving, deflating the opponent's vocal sac, seizing him by the head, jumping on his back, biting, chasing, splashing, and ducking him under the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wells, K. D. | year=1977 | title=Territoriality and male mating success in the green frog (''Rana clamitans'') | journal=Ecology | volume=58 | issue=4 | pages=750–762 | jstor=1936211 | doi=10.2307/1936211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defence mechanisms ==
[[File:Adult Cane toad.jpg|thumb|alt=Cane toad|[[Cane toad]] (''Rhinella marina'') with poison glands behind the eyes]]

Amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins, and lack claws, defensive armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barthalmus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Barthalmus, G. T. |author2=Zielinski W.

[[File:Salamander-olympus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Fire salamander|The [[fire salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra''), a toxic species, wears warning colours.]]

Poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity. These warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black, with the [[fire salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra'') being an example. Once a predator has sampled one of these, it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal. In some species, such as the [[fire-bellied toad]] (''Bombina spp.''), the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked, exhibiting their bright colours to the predator. The frog ''[[Allobates zaparo]]'' is not poisonous, but [[Batesian mimicry|mimics]] the appearance of other toxic species in its locality, a strategy that may deceive predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Darst, Catherine R. |author2=Cummings, Molly E. |date=9 March 2006 |title=Predator learning favours mimicry of a less-toxic model in poison frogs |journal=Nature |volume=440 |pages=208–211 |doi=10.1038/nature04297 |issue=7081 |pmid=16525472 |bibcode=2006Natur.440..208D |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use [[camouflage]] to avoid being detected. They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys and olives to blend into the background. Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American [[northern short-tailed shrew]] (''Blarina brevicauda'').

In amphibians, there is evidence of [[habituation]], [[associative learning]] through both [[Classical conditioning|classical]] and [[instrumental learning]], and discrimination abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hloch, A.|year=2010|title=What Does a Salamander Remember After Winter?|publisher=University of Vienna.

In one experiment, when offered live fruit flies (''[[Drosophila]] virilis''), salamanders chose the larger of 1 vs 2 and 2 vs 3. Frogs can distinguish between low numbers (1 vs 2, 2 vs 3, but not 3 vs 4) and large numbers (3 vs 6, 4 vs 8, but not 4 vs 6) of prey. This is irrespective of other characteristics, i.e. surface area, volume, weight and movement, although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stancher&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stancher, G.|author2= Rugani, R.|author3= Regolin, L.|author4=Vallortigara, G.|authorlink4=Giorgio Vallortigara|year=2015|title=Numerical discrimination by frogs (Bombina orientalis)|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=18|issue=1|pages=219–229|doi=10.1007/s10071-014-0791-7|url=https://www.academia.edu/12580390|pmid=25108417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Decline in amphibian populations}}

[[File:Bufo periglenes1.jpg|thumb|alt=Golden toad|The extinct [[golden toad]] (''Bufo periglenes''), last seen in 1989]]
Dramatic declines in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized [[extinction]], have been noted since the late 1980s from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCallum |first1=M. L. |year=2007 |title=Amphibian decline or extinction? Current declines dwarf background extinction rate |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=483–491 |doi=10.1670/0022-1511(2007)41[483:ADOECD]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) reported stating that currently birds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does it mean to be human?|url=http://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/change|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; mammals, and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural extinction rates—possibly 1,024 times higher.
In 2006 there were believed to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://app.databasin.org/app/pages/datasetPage.jsp?id=461e58214aa54ad79382066ab829c05f |title=Number of Globally Threatened Amphibian Species by Freshwater Ecoregion |author1=Hoekstra, J.

However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amphibians.org/ |title=Amphibian Specialist Group |publisher=IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Israel painted frog.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Hula painted frog|The [[Hula painted frog]] (''Discoglossus nigriventer'') was believed to be extinct but was rediscovered in 2011.]]
With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often considered to be [[ecological indicator]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waddle&quot;&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |chapter= |title=Use of amphibians as ecosystem indicator species |url=http://etd.fcla.edu/UF/UFE0016760/waddle_j.pdf |last=Waddle |first=James Hardin |year=2006 |publisher=University of Florida }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many terrestrial ecosystems, they constitute one of the largest parts of the vertebrate biomass. Any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation. The loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species. In the Middle East, a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in [[mosquito]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Regier| first1 = Henry A.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline. The [[western terrestrial garter snake]] (''Thamnophis elegans'') in California is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers, the [[Yosemite toad]] (''Bufo canorus'') and the [[mountain yellow-legged frog]] (''Rana muscosa''), putting the snake's future at risk. If the snake were to become scarce, this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jennings, W. Bryan |author2=Bradford, David F. |author3=Johnson, Dale F. |year=1992 |title=Dependence of the garter snake ''Thamnophis elegans'' on amphibians in the Sierra Nevada of California |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=503–505 |jstor=1565132 |doi=10.2307/1565132 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270389669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in the ponds and lakes, fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles. These normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on [[detritus]] that accumulates as sediment on the bottom. A reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae, resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose. Aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=249 }}

A [[global strategy]] to stem the crisis was released in 2005 in the form of the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmphibianArk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/offices/asia/regional_activities/asian_amphibian_crisis/taking_action/amphibian_conservation_action_plan/ |title=Amphibian Conservation Action Plan |work=IUCN |accessdate=March 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427134336/http://www.iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/offices/asia/regional_activities/asian_amphibian_crisis/taking_action/amphibian_conservation_action_plan/ |archivedate=April 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amphibian Ark]] is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmphibianArk&quot; /&gt; One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amphibianrescue.org/?page_id=91 |title=Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project |publisher=Amphibian Ark |accessdate=March 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614024615/http://amphibianrescue.org/?page_id=91 |archive-date=June 14, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alaska''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Alaska.ogg|ə|ˈ|l|æ|s|k|ə}}; {{lang-ale|Alax̂sxax̂}}; {{Lang-ik|Alaasikaq}}; [[Alutiiq language|Alutiiq]]: ''Alas'kaaq;'' [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]]: ''Anáaski;'' {{Lang-ru|Аля́ска|translit=Alyáska}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the northwest extremity of the [[West Coast of the United States|United States West Coast]], just across the [[Bering Strait]] from Asia. An [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] of the U.S., it borders the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian]] province of [[British Columbia]] and territory of [[Yukon]] to the east and southeast and has a [[maritime border]] with Russia's [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]] to the west. To the north are the [[Chukchi Sea|Chukchi]] and [[Beaufort Sea|Beaufort]] seas of the Arctic Ocean, while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest.

Alaska is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|largest U.S. state]] by area and the [[List of country subdivisions by area|seventh-largest subnational division in the world]]. It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|third-least populous]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|most sparsely populated]] state, but by far the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the [[60th parallel north|60th parallel]], with an estimated population of 738,432 as 2015—more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PopEstUS&quot; /&gt; Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the [[Anchorage metropolitan area]]. The state capital of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] is the second-[[List of United States cities by area|largest city in the United States by area]], comprising more territory than the states of [[Rhode Island]] and [[Delaware]].

Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]]. The [[Russians]] were the first Europeans to settle the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing [[Russian America]], which spanned most of the current state. The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted [[Alaska Purchase|its sale to the U.S.]] in 1867 for [[US$]]7.2&amp;nbsp;million, or approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a [[Territories of the United States|territory]] on May 11, 1912. It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|year=1959|title=Video: 49th Star. Alaska Statehood, New Flag, Official, 1959/01/05 (1959)|url=https://archive.org/details/1959-01-05_49th_Star_Alaska_Statehood|publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]]|accessdate=February 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515054607/http://archive.org/details/1959-01-05_49th_Star_Alaska_Statehood|archive-date=May 15, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it has one of the smallest state economies in the country, Alaska's [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita|per capita income is among the highest]], owing to a diversified economy dominated by fishing, natural gas, and [[petroleum|oil]], all of which it has in abundance. [[United States armed forces]] bases and [[Tourism in Alaska|tourism]] are also a significant part of the [[Economy of Alaska|economy]]; more than half the state is federally owned public land, including a multitude of [[United States National Forest|national forests]], parks, and [[National wildlife refuge|wildlife refuges]].

Alaska's indigenous population is proportionally the highest of any U.S. state, at over 15 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/AK|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Alaska|website=census.gov|access-date=February 17, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close to two dozen native languages are spoken, and Alaskan Natives exercise considerable influence in local and state politics.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Alaska&quot; ({{lang-rus|Аля́ска|r=Alyáska}}) was introduced in the [[Russian America|Russian colonial period]] when it was used to refer to the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. It was derived from an [[Aleut language|Aleut-language]] [[idiom]], which figuratively refers to the mainland. Literally, it means ''object to which the action of the sea is directed''.&lt;ref name=Aleut&gt;{{cite book|title=Aleut Dictionary: Unangam Tunudgusii |editor=Bergsland, Knut |publisher=Alaska Native Language Center|year=1994|isbn=978-1-55500-047-9}}, at pp. 49 (Alaxsxi-x = mainland Alaska), 50 (''alagu-x'' = ''sea''), 508 (''-gi'' = suffix, ''object of its action'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bright&gt;{{cite book |title=Native American Placenames in the United States|author=Bright, William|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0806135984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, J.

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of Alaska}}

Alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the United States and has the most easterly longitude in the United States because the [[Aleutian Islands]] extend into the [[Eastern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alaska.gov/kids/learn/facts.htm|title=Facts About Alaska, Alaska Kids' Corner, State of Alaska|date=n.d.|website=alaska.gov|accessdate=April 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109130340/http://alaska.gov/kids/learn/facts.htm|archive-date=January 9, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alaska is the only non-[[Contiguous United States|contiguous]] U.S. state on continental North America; about {{convert|500|mi|km|-1}} of [[British Columbia]] (Canada) separates Alaska from [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. It is technically part of the [[Continental United States|continental U.S.]], but is sometimes not included in colloquial use; Alaska is not part of the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous U.S.]], often called [[Outside (Alaska)|&quot;the Lower 48&quot;]]. The capital city, [[Juneau]], is situated on the mainland of the North American continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.

The state is bordered by Canada's [[Yukon]] and [[British Columbia]] to the east (making it the only state to border a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian territory]]), the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and the Pacific Ocean to the south and southwest, the [[Bering Sea]], [[Bering Strait]], and [[Chukchi Sea]] to the west and the Arctic Ocean to the north. Alaska's territorial waters touch Russia's territorial waters in the Bering Strait, as the Russian [[Big Diomede Island]] and Alaskan [[Little Diomede Island]] are only {{convert|3|mi|km}} apart. Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other U.S. states combined.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alaska area compared to conterminous US.svg|thumb|Alaska's size compared with the [[contiguous United States|48 contiguous states]] ([[Albers projection|Albers equal-area conic projection]])]]

Alaska is the largest state in the United States by total area. At {{convert|663268|sqmi|km2|0}} it is more than twice the size of [[Texas]] and—counting territorial waters—larger than Texas, California, and [[Montana]] combined. (Alaska is larger than all but 18 of the world's ''countries''.)

===Regions===

There are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska, but there are six widely accepted regions:

====South Central====

{{Main|South Central Alaska}}

The most populous region of Alaska, containing [[Anchorage]], the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]] and the [[Kenai Peninsula]]. Rural, mostly unpopulated areas south of the [[Alaska Range]] and west of the [[Wrangell Mountains]] also fall within the definition of South Central, as do the [[Prince William Sound]] area and the communities of [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]] and [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]].&lt;ref name=cities&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel Information on South Central Alaska|year=2006|url=http://www.welcometoalaska.com/SouthCentral.htm|accessdate=April 22, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419212447/http://welcometoalaska.com/SouthCentral.htm|archive-date=April 19, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southeast====

{{Main|Southeast Alaska}}

Also referred to as the Panhandle or [[Inside Passage]], this is the region of Alaska closest to the rest of the United States. As such, this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the [[Alaska Purchase]]. The region is dominated by the [[Alexander Archipelago]] as well as the [[Tongass National Forest]], the largest national forest in the United States. It contains the state capital [[Juneau]], the former capital [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], and [[Ketchikan]], at one time Alaska's largest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/Ketchikan/043007_ketchikan_1927.html |title=1927: When Ketchikan was the Largest City in Alaska |website=Sitnews US |date=April 30, 2007 |accessdate=July 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510144910/http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/Ketchikan/043007_ketchikan_1927.html |archive-date=May 10, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alaska Marine Highway]] provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area, as only three communities ([[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]] and [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]]) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOT Document&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities |publisher= Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities |url= http://www.dot.state.ak.us/amhs/doc/presskit.pdf |title= The Alaska Marine Highway System |access-date= April 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130330013507/http://www.dot.state.ak.us/amhs/doc/presskit.pdf |archivedate= March 30, 2013 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interior====

{{Main|Alaska Interior}}
[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|[[Denali]] is the highest peak in North America.]]

The Interior is the largest region of Alaska; much of it is uninhabited wilderness. [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] is the only large city in the region. [[Denali National Park and Preserve]] is located here. ''[[Denali]]'' is the highest mountain in North America.

====Southwest====

{{Main|Southwest Alaska}}
[[File:Grizzly Bear Fishing Brooks Falls.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Grizzly bear]] fishing for [[salmon]] at [[Brooks Falls]], part of [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]]]]

Southwest Alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some {{convert|500|mi|km}} inland from the Bering Sea. Most of the population lives along the coast. [[Kodiak Island]] is also located in Southwest. The massive [[Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta]], one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here. Portions of the [[Alaska Peninsula]] are considered part of Southwest, with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands (see below).

====North Slope====

{{Main|Alaska North Slope}}

The North Slope is mostly [[tundra]] peppered with small villages. The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil, and contains both the [[National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska]] and the [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alaska.com |url=http://www.alaska.com/regions/ |title=Alaska.com |publisher=Alaska.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603064023/http://www.alaska.com/regions/ |archivedate=June 3, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Utqiagvik, Alaska|Utqiagvik]], formerly known as Barrow, is the northernmost city in the United States and is located here. The [[Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska|Northwest Arctic area]], anchored by [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]] and also containing the [[Kobuk River]] valley, is often regarded as being part of this region. However, the respective [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Aleutian Islands====

{{Main|Aleutian Islands}}

More than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain, which stretches more than {{convert|1200|mi}} into the Pacific Ocean. Some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere, but the [[International Date Line]] was drawn west of [[180th meridian|180°]] to keep the whole state, and thus the entire North American continent, within the same legal day. Two of the islands, [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]], were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II.

===Natural features===

{{see also|Wildlife of Alaska}}
[[File:Augustine Volcano Jan 12 2006 edited-1.jpg|thumb|[[Augustine Volcano]] erupting on January 12, 2006]]

With its myriad islands, Alaska has nearly {{convert|34000|mi|km|-3}} of tidal shoreline. The [[Aleutian Islands]] chain extends west from the southern tip of the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. Many active [[volcano]]es are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions. [[Unimak Island]], for example, is home to [[Mount Shishaldin]], which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to {{convert|10000|ft|m|-3}} above the North Pacific. It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth, even more symmetrical than Japan's [[Mount Fuji]]. The chain of volcanoes extends to [[Mount Spurr]], west of Anchorage on the mainland. Geologists have identified Alaska as part of [[Wrangellia]], a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the [[Pacific Northwest]], which is actively undergoing [[plate tectonics|continent building]].

One of the world's largest tides occurs in [[Turnagain Arm]], just south of Anchorage, where tidal differences can be more than {{convert|35|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Porco, Peter|date = June 23, 2003 | title = Long said to be second to Fundy, city tides aren't even close | journal=[[Anchorage Daily News]] | pages = A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land ownership===

[[File:Public Lands Held by the National Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.svg|thumb|Alaska has more public land owned by the federal government than any other state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wildlandfire.com/docs/2007/western-states-data-public-land.htm |title=Western States Data Public Land Acreage |publisher=Wildlandfire.com |date=November 13, 2007 |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727120656/http://www.wildlandfire.com/docs/2007/western-states-data-public-land.htm |archive-date=July 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

According to an October 1998 report by the [[United States Bureau of Land Management]], approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] as public lands, including a multitude of [[United States National Forest|national forests]], national parks, and [[national wildlife refuge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrm.salrm.uaf.edu/~stodd/AlaskaPlanningDirectory/landOwnership.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020628125756/http://nrm.salrm.uaf.edu/~stodd/AlaskaPlanningDirectory/landOwnership.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2002 |title=Alaska Land Ownership |accessdate=May 4, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] manages {{convert|87|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}}, or 23.8% of the state. The [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] is managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]. It is the world's largest wildlife refuge, comprising {{convert|16|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}}.

Of the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns {{convert|101|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}}, its entitlement under the [[Alaska Statehood Act]]. A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs. Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities. These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations. The [[University of Alaska]], as a [[land grant university]], also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.

Another {{convert|44|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}} are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA) of 1971. [[Alaska Native Regional Corporation|Regional Native corporation]] [[Doyon, Limited]] often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications. Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect. Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land. [[Alaska Native Allotment Act|Individual Native allotments]] can be and are sold on the open market, however.

Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state. Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded.

===Climate===

{{Main|Climate of Alaska}}
[[File:Alaska Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Alaska]]
[[File:Alaska climate regions USGS.gif|thumb|Climate zones of Alaska]]

The climate in Southeast Alaska is a mid-latitude [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfb'') in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate (Köppen ''Cfc'') in the northern parts. On an annual basis, Southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over {{convert|50|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year, and [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] averages over {{convert|150|in|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Monthly Climate Summary, Ketchikan, Alaska | publisher = Western Regional Climate Center | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?akketc | accessdate = February 7, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130516005502/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?akketc | archive-date = May 16, 2013 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.

The climate of [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. On average, [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] receives {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year, with around {{convert|75|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow. It is a subarctic climate ([[Köppen climate classification#GROUP D: Continental/microthermal climate|Köppen: ''Dfc'']]) due to its brief, cool summers.

The climate of [[Southwest Alaska|Western Alaska]] is determined in large part by the [[Bering Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Alaska]]. It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation. An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the [[Kobuk River]] valley (i.&amp;nbsp;e., the region around [[Kotzebue Sound]]) is technically a [[desert]], with portions receiving less than {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually. On the other extreme, some locations between [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]] and [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]] average around {{convert|100|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-YK Precip&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Mean Annual Precipitation, Alaska-Yukon|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~mabbott1/climate/mark/Images/AK-PPT-mm.gif|website=Spatial Climate Analysis Service|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=June 5, 2012|date=February 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025125522/http://www.pitt.edu/~mabbott1/climate/mark/Images/AK-PPT-mm.gif|archive-date=October 25, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic. Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]]. The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s °F (the low-to-mid 30s °C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below {{convert|-60|°F}}. Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter.

The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior. The highest is {{convert|100|°F}} in [[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]] (which is just {{convert|8|mi|km|sp=us|disp=or|abbr=on}} inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915,&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA-All Hazards&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards Information—Alaska Weather Interesting Facts and Records |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |url=http://www.arh.noaa.gov/docs/AKWXfacts.pdf |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929022606/http://www.arh.noaa.gov/docs/AKWXfacts.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DRI&gt;{{cite web|title=State Extremes |publisher=Western Regional Climate Center, [[Desert Research Institute]] |url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105015744/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html |archivedate=January 5, 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SD Weather History and Trivia for May: May 1 | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | url = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/?n=fsdtrivia05 | accessdate = January 3, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208132328/http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/?n=fsdtrivia05 | archive-date = February 8, 2007 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQ ALASKA—Frequently Asked Questions About Alaska: Weather |publisher=Statewide Library Electronic Doorway, [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] |date=January 17, 2005 |url=http://sled.alaska.edu/akfaq/aksuper.html#wea |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102180919/http://sled.alaska.edu/akfaq/aksuper.html#wea |archivedate=January 2, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest official Alaska temperature is {{convert|−80|°F}} in [[Prospect Creek, Alaska|Prospect Creek]] on January 23, 1971,&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA-All Hazards&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=DRI /&gt; one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in [[Snag, Yukon|Snag, Yukon, Canada]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ned Rozell |title=The Coldest Place in North America |publisher=Geophysical Institute of the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] |date=January 23, 2003 |url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF16/1630.html |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202040955/http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF16/1630.html |archivedate=February 2, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-colonization===

{{Main|Alaska Natives}}
[[File:AlutiiqDancer.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A modern [[Alutiiq people|Alutiiq]] dancer in traditional festival garb]]

Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/human-journey/|title=Map of Human Migration|access-date=November 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519020315/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/human-journey/|archive-date=May 19, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Upward Sun River site]] in the Tanana River Valley in Alaska, remains of a six-week-old infant were found. The baby's DNA showed that she belonged to a population that was genetically separate from other native groups present elsewhere in the [[New World]] at the end of the [[Pleistocene]]. Ben Potter, the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] archaeologist who unearthed the remains at the Upward River Sun site in 2013, named this new group [[Ancient Beringians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/01/alaska-dna-ancient-beringia-genome/|title=Lost Native American Ancestor Revealed in Ancient Child's DNA|magazine=National Geographic|date=January 3, 2018|access-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103235253/https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/01/alaska-dna-ancient-beringia-genome/|archive-date=January 3, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tlingit people]] developed a society with a [[matrilineal]] kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the [[Haida people|Haida]], now well known for their unique arts. The [[Tsimshian]] people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President [[Grover Cleveland]], and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on [[Annette Island]] and found the town of [[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]]. All three of these peoples, as well as other [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]], experienced [[smallpox]] outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating [[epidemics]] occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.&lt;ref&gt;Brian C. Hosmer, ''American Indians in the Marketplace: Persistence and Innovation among the Menominees and Metlakatlans, 1870–1920'' (Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 1999), pp. 129–131, 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aleutian Islands are still home to the [[Aleut people]]'s seafaring society, although they were the first Native Alaskans to be exploited by the Russians. Western and Southwestern Alaska are home to the [[Yup'ik]], while their cousins the [[Alutiiq people|Alutiiq ~ Sugpiaq]] lived in what is now Southcentral Alaska. The [[Gwich'in people]] of the northern Interior region are [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabaskan]] and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. The North Slope and [[Little Diomede Island]] are occupied by the widespread [[Inupiat people]].

===Colonization===

[[File:1860-russian-america.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of Russian America in 1860]]

Some researchers believe the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Свердлов Л. М. Русское поселение на Аляске в XVII в.? &quot;Природа&quot;. М., 1992. No. 4. С.67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hypothesis, in 1648 several [[Koch (boat)|koches]] of [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]'s expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement. This hypothesis is based on the testimony of [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] geographer Nikolai Daurkin, who had visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the Kheuveren River, populated by &quot;bearded men&quot; who &quot;pray to the [[icons]]&quot;. Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with [[Koyuk River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4877141/ALEXEI-V-POSTNIKOV-nautical-charts-compiled-by-these-promyshlenniki |title=Outline of the History of Russian Cartography |website=Regions: a Prism to View the Slavic Eurasian World |year=2000 |first=Alexey V. |last=Postnikov |authorlink=Alexey Postnikov |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117073034/http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4877141/ALEXEI-V-POSTNIKOV-nautical-charts-compiled-by-these-promyshlenniki |archivedate=January 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European vessel to reach Alaska is generally held to be the ''St. Gabriel'' under the authority of the surveyor [[Mikhail Gvozdev|M. S. Gvozdev]] and assistant navigator [[Ivan Fyodorov (navigator)|I. Fyodorov]] on August 21, 1732, during an expedition of Siberian cossak A. F. Shestakov and Russian explorer [[Dmitry Pavlutsky]] (1729–1735).&lt;ref&gt;Аронов В. Н. Патриарх Камчатского мореходства. // &quot;Вопросы истории рыбной промышленности Камчатки&quot;: Историко-краеведческий сб.—Вып. 3.—2000. Вахрин С. Покорители великого океана. Петроп.-Камч.: Камштат, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741, when [[Vitus Bering]] led an [[second Kamchatka expedition|expedition]] for the Russian Navy aboard the ''St. Peter''. After his crew returned to Russia with [[sea otter]] pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.
[[File:Russian Sloop-of-War Neva.jpg|thumb|left|The Russian settlement of St. Paul's Harbor (present-day [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak town]]), [[Kodiak Island]], 1814]]

Between 1774 and 1800, [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spain]] sent several [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to Alaska]] to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789 a Spanish settlement and [[Fort San Miguel|fort]] were built in [[Nootka Sound]]. These expeditions gave names to places such as [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], [[Bucareli Sound]], and [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]. Later, the [[Russian-American Company]] carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.

[[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], renamed [[New Archangel]] from 1804 to 1867, on [[Baranof Island]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in what is now [[Southeast Alaska]], became the capital of [[Russian America]]. It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska.

[[William H. Seward]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2&amp;nbsp;million; the purchase was made on March 30, 1867. Six months later the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged; the formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. In the ceremony 250 uniformed U.S. soldiers marched to the governor's house at &quot;Castle Hill&quot;, where the Russian troops lowered the Russian flag and the U.S. flag was raised. This event is celebrated as [[Alaska Day]], a legal holiday on October 18.

Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a [[District of Alaska|district]] starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the President of the United States. A federal [[United States territorial court|district court]] was headquartered in Sitka.

[[File:Miners climb Chilkoot.jpg|thumb|Miners and prospectors climb the [[Chilkoot Trail]] during the 1898 [[Klondike Gold Rush]]]]

For most of Alaska's first decade under the United States flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers. They organized a &quot;provisional city government&quot;, which was Alaska's first municipal government, but not in a legal sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Keith|chapter=Learning to cope with 'Seward's Icebox'|title=The Alaskans|url=https://archive.org/details/alaskans00time|url-access=registration|year=1977|publisher=[[Time–Life Books]]|location=[[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]]|isbn=978-0-8094-1506-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/alaskans00time/page/57 57–64]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900, and [[Home rule#Home rule in the United States|home rule]] for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959.

===Alaska as an incorporated U.S. territory===
{{Main|Organic act#List of organic acts|Territory of Alaska}}

Starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s, gold rushes in Alaska and the nearby [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska. Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912. Alaska's capital, which had been in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] until 1906, was moved north to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. Construction of the [[Alaska Governor's Mansion]] began that same year. European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska, where they entered the fishing and logging industries.
[[File:US troops at the Battle of Attu.jpg|thumb|U.S. troops navigate snow and ice during the [[Battle of Attu]] in May 1943]]

During World War II, the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] focused on [[Attu Island|Attu]], [[Agattu]] and [[Kiska Island|Kiska]], all which were occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;these three Aleutian outer islands are about {{convert|460|mi|km}} away from mainland USSR, {{convert|920|mi|km}} from mainland Alaska, {{convert|950|mi|km}} from Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Japanese occupation, a white American civilian and two [[United States Navy]] personnel were killed at Attu and Kiska respectively, and nearly a total of 50 Aleut civilians and eight sailors were interned in Japan. About half of the Aleuts died during the period of internment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cloe |first1=John Haile |last2=Service |first2=United States National Park |title=Attu: the forgotten battle |date=2017 |publisher=Government Printing Office |isbn=978-0-9965837-3-2 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=-t6J21RGruEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9780996583732&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCt7XBmN3oAhWJu54KHXALCq8Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unalaska]]/[[Dutch Harbor]] and [[Adak, Alaska|Adak]] became significant bases for the [[United States Army]], [[United States Army Air Forces]] and [[United States Navy]]. The United States [[Lend-Lease]] program involved flying American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and then Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.

===Statehood===

{{See also|Alaska Statehood Act|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}

Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of [[James Wickersham]] early in his tenure as a congressional delegate. Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946. The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow. Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska. Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.

In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alaska—Race and Hispanic Origin: 1880 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archivedate=December 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Good Friday earthquake===

{{Main|1964 Alaska earthquake}}

On March 27, 1964, the massive [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]] killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant [[tsunamis]] and landslides. It was the [[Largest earthquakes by magnitude|second-most-powerful earthquake]] in recorded history, with a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 9.2 (more than a thousand times as powerful as the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|1989 San Francisco earthquake]]).{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} The time of day (5:36&amp;nbsp;pm), time of year (spring) and location of the [[epicenter]] were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage.{{By whom|date=June 2020}}

===Discovery of oil===

The 1968 discovery of oil at [[Prudhoe Bay]] and the 1977 completion of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] led to an oil boom. Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward. That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.

In 1989, the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' hit a reef in the [[Prince William Sound]], [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|spilling]] more than {{convert|11|MUSgal|Ml|lk=out|abbr=off|sp=us}} of crude oil over {{convert|1100|mi}} of coastline. Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] and the proposed [[Pebble Mine]].

===Alaska Heritage Resources Survey===

The Alaska Heritage Resources Survey (AHRS) is a restricted [[inventory]] of all reported [[historic site|historic]] and [[prehistoric]] sites within the state of Alaska; it is maintained by the Office of History and Archaeology. The survey's inventory of cultural resources includes objects, structures, buildings, sites, districts, and travel ways, with a general provision that they are more than fifty years old. {{as of|2012|January|31|df=}}, more than 35,000 sites have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/oha/ahrs/ahrs.htm Alaska Heritage Resources Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513010517/http://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/oha/ahrs/ahrs.htm |date=May 13, 2014 }}, Department of Natural Resources—Alaska.gov (retrieved May 9, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 [[gross state product]] was $55&amp;nbsp;billion, 48th in the nation. Its [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita (nominal)|per capita personal income]] for 2018 was $73,000, ranking 7th in the nation.

Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.

Agriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.

Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.

Alaska has vast energy resources, although its oil reserves have been largely depleted. Major oil and gas reserves were found in the [[Alaska North Slope]] (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the [[Energy Information Administration]], by February 2014 Alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota, and California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=ak |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Alaska |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |date=March 27, 2014 |accessdate=May 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522070348/http://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=ak |archive-date=May 22, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rankings: Crude Oil Production, February 2013|url=http://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/?sid=US&amp;CFID=11011948&amp;CFTOKEN=1da5d5e517e7a485-37ABEB4E-25B3-1C83-549C71EE21A56018&amp;jsessionid=84305d8fd0e59a4565705d1e106846494687#/series/46|publisher=United States Energy Information Administration|accessdate=May 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019131529/http://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/?sid=US&amp;CFID=11011948&amp;CFTOKEN=1da5d5e517e7a485-37ABEB4E-25B3-1C83-549C71EE21A56018&amp;jsessionid=84305d8fd0e59a4565705d1e106846494687#/series/46|archive-date=October 19, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the United States, typically producing about {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}, although by early 2014 North Dakota's [[Bakken Formation]] was producing over {{convert|900000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/stats/historicalbakkenoilstats.pdf | title=ND Monthly Bakken Oil Production Statistics | publisher=North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources | accessdate=May 21, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714181113/https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/stats/historicalbakkenoilstats.pdf | archive-date=July 14, 2014 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prudhoe Bay was the largest [[conventional oil]] field ever discovered in North America, but was much smaller than Canada's enormous [[Athabasca oil sands]] field, which by 2014 was producing about {{convert | 1500000 | oilbbl/d | m3/d}} of [[unconventional oil]], and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.capp.ca/getdoc.aspx?DocId=227308 | title=Crude Oil Forecast, Markets and Transportation | publisher=Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers | date=June 2013 | accessdate=May 21, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522084514/http://www.capp.ca/getdoc.aspx?DocId=227308 | archive-date=May 22, 2014 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] can transport and pump up to {{convert|2.1|Moilbbl|m3}} of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States. Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins.

Alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Although wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special [[single-wire earth return#Use in interties|low-cost electric interties]]) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216014031/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |url=http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf |title=Screening Report for Alaska Rural Energy Plan |date=April 2001 |url-status=dead |access-date=April 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.

====Permanent Fund====

The [[Alaska Permanent Fund]] is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]]. The fund was originally proposed by Governor [[Keith Harvey Miller|Keith Miller]] on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900&amp;nbsp;million) at once. It was later championed by Governor [[Jay Hammond]] and [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]] [[Alaska House of Representatives|state representative]] Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.

The [[Alaska Constitution]] was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50&amp;nbsp;billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apfc.org/|title=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|website=apfc.org|access-date=May 29, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520095308/http://www.apfc.org/|archive-date=May 20, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.

Starting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 &quot;Resource Rebate&quot;). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans. To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/dividendamounts/index.aspx |title=State of Alaska Permanent Fund Division |publisher=Pfd.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420014117/http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/dividendamounts/index.aspx |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.

The Permanent Fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a &quot;[[Basic income]]&quot; policy in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Alaska's Citizens' Dividend Set To Be Near Highest Ever|url = http://www.basicincome.org/news/2015/08/alaska-usa-dividend-amount-estimated-to-be-near-highest-ever/|website = BIEN|accessdate = November 3, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151103055141/http://www.basicincome.org/news/2015/08/alaska-usa-dividend-amount-estimated-to-be-near-highest-ever/|archive-date = November 3, 2015|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost of living===

The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. Federal government employees, particularly [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) workers and active-duty military members, receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because, while the cost of living has gone down, it is still one of the highest in the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Agriculture and fishing===

[[File:Pacific Halibut Fileting.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Halibut]], both as a sport fish and commercially, is important to the state's economy.]]

Due to the northern climate and short growing season, relatively little farming occurs in Alaska. Most farms are in either the [[Matanuska Valley]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} northeast of [[Anchorage]], or on the [[Kenai Peninsula]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.

The [[Tanana Valley]] is another notable agricultural locus, especially the [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]] area, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of [[Fort Greely]]. This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and [[community-supported agriculture]].

Alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of [[market gardener]]s, small farms and [[farmers' market]]s in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011/08/0338.xml&amp;printable=true&amp;contentidonly=true |title=More than 1,000 New Farmers Markets Recorded Across Country as USDA Directory Reveals 17 Percent Growth—USDA Newsroom |publisher=Usda.gov |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117072838/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011%2F08%2F0338.xml&amp;printable=true&amp;contentidonly=true |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[peony]] industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alaskapeonies.org/ |title=Welcome to The Alaska Peony Growers Association |publisher=Alaskapeonies.org |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630050159/http://alaskapeonies.org/ |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs. However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the [[Alaska State Fair]] in [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] the largest), are held mostly in the late summer. The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. &quot;Alaska Grown&quot; is used as an agricultural slogan.

Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport. This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main |title=Alaska Department of Fish and Game |publisher=Adfg.alaska.gov |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624202032/http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main |archivedate=June 24, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunting for subsistence, primarily [[caribou]], [[moose]], and [[Dall sheep]] is still common in the state, particularly in remote [[The Bush (Alaska)|Bush]] communities. An example of a traditional native food is [[Akutaq]], the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.

Alaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on [[Seward Peninsula]], where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |title=Reindeer Herding |publisher=Reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119004453/http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |archive-date=November 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from [[Outside (Alaska)|&quot;Outside&quot;]], and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Although most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a {{convert|1|USgal|L}} of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely twenty to thirty cents higher than the continental United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Fuel Gauge Report|url=http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http://fuelgaugereport.opisnet.com/index.asp|publisher=Automobile Association of America|accessdate=May 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620090230/http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http%3A%2F%2Ffuelgaugereport.opisnet.com%2Findex.asp|archive-date=June 20, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retail Fuel Pricing and News|url=http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|publisher=Oil Price Information Service|accessdate=May 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602043909/http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|archive-date=June 2, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the [[Alaska Highway]], the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry; this has spurred debate over decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]. The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska.
[[File:AlaskaSign.jpg|right|thumb|Alaska welcome sign on the [[Klondike Highway]]]]

The [[Interstate Highways in Alaska]] consists of a total of 1082 miles. One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the [[Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel]], an active [[Alaska Railroad]] tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] on [[Prince William Sound]] to the [[Seward Highway]] about {{convert|50|mi|km}} southeast of Anchorage at [[Portage, Alaska|Portage]]. At {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1}}, the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;completion of the {{convert|3.5|mi|km|adj=on|1}} [[Interstate 93]] tunnel as part of the &quot;[[Big Dig]]&quot; project in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel is the longest combination [[List of road-rail tunnels|road and rail tunnel]] in North America.

===Rail===

Built around 1915, the [[Alaska Railroad]] (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century. It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to [[Interior Alaska]] by way of [[South Central Alaska]], passing through Anchorage, [[Eklutna]], Wasilla, [[Talkeetna, Alaska|Talkeetna]], [[Denali]], and Fairbanks, with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] and [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]]. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as &quot;The Railbelt&quot;. In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.

The railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage). It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.

The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use [[caboose]]s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last [[Request stop|flag stop]] routes in the country. A stretch of about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.

In northern Southeast Alaska, the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] also partly runs through the state from [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at [[White Pass]] Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Great Little Railways]].''

The Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. (The nearest link to the North American railway network is the northwest terminus of the [[Canadian National Railway]] at [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], several hundred miles to the southeast.) In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6&amp;nbsp;million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48.&lt;ref name=&quot;RailLink1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/powerplay/archive/2010/12/13/transporting-oil-across-b-c.aspx |title=Alaska Oil / BC Tar sands via rail |author=Barbara Yaffe |date=January 2, 2011 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219014658/http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/powerplay/archive/2010/12/13/transporting-oil-across-b-c.aspx |archivedate=December 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RailLink2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2138860820070622 | title=Economic study touts Alaska-Canada rail link | author=Allan Dowd | date=June 27, 2007 | accessdate=January 2, 2011 | agency=Reuters | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713120019/https://www.reuters.com/article/environment-alaska-railway-dc/economic-study-touts-alaska-canada-rail-link-idUSN2138860820070621 | archive-date=July 13, 2019 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RailLink3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alaskacanadarail.com/index.html |title=Alaska Canada Rail Link |author=AlaskaCanadaRail.org |date=January 2, 2005 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425025223/http://alaskacanadarail.com/index.html |archivedate=April 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alaska Rail Marine]] provides [[car float]] service between [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] and [[Seattle]].

===Marine transport===

Many cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea.

[[File:Tustumena, Alaska Marine Highway.jpg|thumb|The {{MV|Tustumena}} (named after [[Tustumena Glacier]]) is one of the state's many ferries, providing service between the [[Kenai Peninsula]], [[Kodiak Island]] and the [[Aleutian Chain]].]]

Alaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the [[Alaska Marine Highway]]) serves the cities of [[Southeast Alaska|southeast]], the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula. The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers. The system also operates a ferry service from [[Bellingham, Washington]] and [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], in Canada through the [[Inside Passage]] to [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]]. The [[Inter-Island Ferry Authority]] also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]] region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway.

In recent years, cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market, mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and, to a lesser degree, towns along Alaska's gulf coast. The population of [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] for example fluctuates dramatically on many days—up to four large cruise ships can dock there at the same time.

===Air transport===

Cities not served by road, sea, or river can be reached only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine, accounting for Alaska's extremely well developed [[Alaskan Bush|bush]] air services—an Alaskan novelty. Anchorage and, to a lesser extent Fairbanks, is served by [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport#Airlines and destinations|many major airlines]]. Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]] to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2012–2013, Alaska received almost two million visitors).&lt;ref&gt;

Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the [[Essential Air Service]] program. [[Alaska Airlines]] is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger [[Boeing 737]]-400s) from Anchorage and [[Fairbanks International Airport|Fairbanks]] to regional hubs like [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities.
[[File:ERA Aviation prop plane landing at ANC (6194226738).jpg|thumb|A [[Bombardier Dash 8]], operated by [[Era Alaska]], on approach to [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]]]]

The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as [[Ravn Alaska]], [[PenAir]], and [[Frontier Flying Service]]. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the [[Cessna Caravan]], the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.

Many communities have small air taxi services. These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas. Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is [[Lake Hood Seaplane Base|Lake Hood]], located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs. In 2006 Alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state.&lt;ref&gt;
Out of the estimated 663,661 residents, 8,550 were pilots, or about one in 78, Federal Aviation Administration.

===Other transport===

Another Alaskan transportation method is the [[dogsled]]. In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog [[mushing]] is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]], a {{convert|1150|mi|adj=on}} trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at {{convert|1049|mi|km|disp=or|abbr=out}}). The race commemorates the famous [[1925 serum run to Nome]] in which mushers and dogs like [[Togo (dog)|Togo]] and [[Balto]] took much-needed medicine to the [[diphtheria]]-stricken community of [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. The &quot;Serum Run&quot; is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]] (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serumrun.org/ |title=Norman Vaughan Serum Run |publisher=United Nations |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303205023/http://serumrun.org/ |archivedate=March 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by [[all-terrain vehicle]] and in winter by [[snowmobile]] or &quot;snow machine&quot;, as it is commonly referred to in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsminer.com/features/outdoors/snowmachine-or-snowmobile-whatever-you-call-it-there-s-a/article_5fd98c50-df56-11e4-a289-b3b886d32b2c.html |title=Snowmachine or snowmobile?

===Data transport===

Alaska's internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies: [[GCI (company)|GCI]] and [[Alaska Communications]]. GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskaunited.com/|title=Alaska United Fiber Optic System homepage|publisher=Alaskaunited.com|accessdate=July 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206052641/http://www.alaskaunited.com/|archive-date=February 6, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of late 2011 Alaska Communications advertised that it has &quot;two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaskacommunications.com/Personal/Wireless/Coverage-Map.aspx Alaska Communications Coverage Map] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107193333/http://www.alaskacommunications.com/Personal/Wireless/Coverage-Map.aspx |date=January 7, 2012 }}. Alaska Communications.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, it was reported that a $1&amp;nbsp;billion project to connect Asia and rural Alaska was being planned, aided in part by $350&amp;nbsp;million in stimulus from the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;

==Law and government==
===State government===

{{Main|Government of Alaska}}
[[File:Juneau, Alaska Downtown.jpg|thumb|The center of state government in [[Juneau]]. The large buildings in the background are, from left to right: the Court Plaza Building (known colloquially as the &quot;[[Spam (food)|Spam Can]]&quot;), the State Office Building (behind), the Alaska Office Building, the [[List of justices of the Alaska Supreme Court|John H. Dimond]] State Courthouse, and the [[Alaska State Capitol]]. Many of the smaller buildings in the foreground are also occupied by state government agencies.]]

Like all other U.S. states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three [[separation of powers|branches of government]]: an [[executive branch]] consisting of the [[governor of Alaska]] and his or her appointees which head executive departments; a [[legislative branch]] consisting of the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] and [[Alaska Senate]]; and a [[judicial branch]] consisting of the [[Alaska Supreme Court]] and lower courts.

The state of Alaska employs approximately 16,000 people statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doa.alaska.gov/dop/fileadmin/DOP_Home/pdf/dopannualreport.pdf |title=State of Alaska Workforce Profile Fiscal Year 2013 |publisher=Dop.state.ak.us |accessdate=May 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330005824/http://doa.alaska.gov/dop/fileadmin/DOP_Home/pdf/dopannualreport.pdf |archive-date=March 30, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alaska Legislature]] consists of a 40-member [[Alaska House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and a 20-member [[Alaska Senate|Senate]]. Senators serve four-year terms and House members two. The [[governor of Alaska]] serves four-year terms. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alaska|lieutenant governor]] runs separately from the governor in the [[Primary election|primaries]], but during the general election, the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket.

Alaska's court system has four levels: the [[Alaska Supreme Court]], the [[Alaska Court of Appeals]], the superior courts and the district courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.ak.us/courts/ctinfo.htm |title=About the Alaska Court System |publisher=State.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913093708/http://www.state.ak.us/courts/ctinfo.htm |archivedate=September 13, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The superior and district courts are [[trial court]]s. Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts hear only certain types of cases, including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to $100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot; /&gt;

The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals are [[appellate court]]s. The Court of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower-court decisions, including those regarding criminal prosecutions, juvenile delinquency, and [[habeas corpus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot; /&gt; The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot; /&gt;

Although in its early years of statehood Alaska was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state, since the early 1970s it has been characterized as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-leaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://election.nationaljournal.com/states/ak.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115144037/http://election.nationaljournal.com/states/ak.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 15, 2006 |title=National Journal Alaska State Profile |publisher=Election.nationaljournal.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development, fishing, tourism, and individual rights. [[Alaska Natives]], while organized in and around their communities, have been active within the [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|Native corporations]]. These have been given ownership over large tracts of land, which require stewardship.

Alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one's home was completely legal under state law, though the federal law remains in force.&lt;ref name=seattle_times&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003118645_webpot10.html |title=Judge rules against Alaska marijuana law |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |last=Volz |first=Matt |date=July 11, 2006 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |publisher=Frank A.

The state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States, with the [[Alaskan Independence Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AIPqa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akip.org/faqs.html|title=Questions And Answers—About Alaskan Independence|year=2006|publisher=Alaskan Independence Party|access-date=January 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104011721/http://www.akip.org/faqs.html|archive-date=January 4, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and four [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have served as governor of Alaska. In addition, Republican governor [[Wally Hickel]] was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected. He officially rejoined the Republican party in 1994.

Alaska's voter initiative making marijuana legal took effect on February 24, 2015, placing Alaska alongside Colorado and Washington as the first three U.S. states where recreational marijuana is legal. The new law means people over 21 can consume small amounts of pot—[[Alaska Measure 2 (2014)|if they can find it]]. (It is still illegal to sell.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/02/24/388673136/marijuana-is-now-legal-in-alaska-the-third-u-s-state-to-ok-pot |title=Marijuana Is Now Legal in Alaska, The 3rd U.S. State With Legal Pot |accessdate=February 25, 2015 |last=Chappel |first=Bill |date=February 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224213811/http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/02/24/388673136/marijuana-is-now-legal-in-alaska-the-third-u-s-state-to-ok-pot |archive-date=February 24, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first legal marijuana store opened in Valdez in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Laurel,[https://www.adn.com/alaska-marijuana/2016/10/29/anticipation-builds-as-alaskas-first-marijuana-store-set-to-open-to-the-public/ Marijuana milestone: Alaska's first pot shop opens to the public in Valdez] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116020638/https://www.adn.com/alaska-marijuana/2016/10/29/anticipation-builds-as-alaskas-first-marijuana-store-set-to-open-to-the-public/ |date=November 16, 2016 }} ''[[Alaska Dispatch News]], October 29, 2016''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxes===

To finance state government operations, Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies. This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;CNN Money (2005). &quot;How tax friendly is your state?&quot; Retrieved from [http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/taxesbystate2005/index.html CNN website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913132712/http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/taxesbystate2005/index.html |date=September 13, 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of five states with no [[sales tax]], one of seven states with no individual [[income tax]], and -- along with [[New Hampshire]] -- one of two that has neither.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newsday.com/business/12-states-with-either-no-income-or-sales-taxes-include-texas-florida-washington-1.13826242 |title=12 states that have either no income or sales taxes |newspaper=Newsday |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215050630/https://www.newsday.com/business/12-states-with-either-no-income-or-sales-taxes-include-texas-florida-washington-1.13826242 |archive-date=February 15, 2019 |url-status=live }}|&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Revenue Tax Division&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.Tax.alaska.gov |title=Alaska Department of Revenue |publisher=Tax.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610221601/http://www.tax.alaska.gov/ |archive-date=June 10, 2010 |url-status=dead }}|&lt;/ref&gt; reports regularly on the state's revenue sources. The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations, including new state laws that directly affect the tax division.

While Alaska has no state sales tax, 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax, from 1.0–7.5%, typically 3–5%. Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes, hotel, motel, and bed-and-breakfast 'bed' taxes, [[severance tax]]es, liquor and tobacco taxes, gaming (pull tabs) taxes, tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes. A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees (such as petroleum, aviation motor fuel, telephone cooperative) is shared with municipalities in Alaska.

[[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]] (FNSB). A sales tax for the FNSB has been voted on many times, but has yet to be approved, leading lawmakers to increase taxes dramatically on goods such as liquor and tobacco.

In 2014 the [[Tax Foundation]] ranked Alaska as having the fourth most &quot;business friendly&quot; tax policy, behind only [[Wyoming]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/blog/how-friendly-your-states-tax-system-tax-foundations-2014-state-business-tax-climate-index |title=How Friendly Is Your State's Tax System?

[[File:Presidential vote in Alaska.png|thumb|A line graph showing the presidential vote by party from 1960 to 2016 in Alaska]]

Alaska regularly supports [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in presidential elections and has done so since statehood. Republicans have won the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] votes in all but one election that it has participated in ([[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]). No state has voted for a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate fewer times. Alaska was carried by Democratic nominee [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] during his landslide election in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], while the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]] and [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] elections were close. Since [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]], however, Republicans have carried the state by large margins. In [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Republican [[John McCain]] defeated Democrat [[Barack Obama]] in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%. McCain's running mate was [[Sarah Palin]], the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket. Obama lost Alaska again in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], but he captured 40% of the state's vote in that election, making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968.

The [[The Bush (Alaska)|Alaska Bush]], central Juneau, midtown and downtown Anchorage, and the areas surrounding the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] campus and Ester have been strongholds of the Democratic Party. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the majority of Fairbanks (including North Pole and the military base), and South Anchorage typically have the strongest Republican showing. {{as of|2004}}, well over half of all registered voters have chosen &quot;non-partisan&quot; or &quot;undeclared&quot; as their affiliation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/regbypty.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225223222/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/regbypty.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |title=State of Alaska |publisher=Gov.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite recent attempts to close primaries to unaffiliated voters.

Because of its population relative to other U.S. states, Alaska has only one member in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. This seat is held by Republican [[Don Young]], who was re-elected to his 21st consecutive term in 2012. [[Alaska's at-large congressional district]] is one of the largest parliamentary constituencies in the world by area.

In 2008, Governor [[Sarah Palin]] became the first Republican woman to run on a national ticket when she became [[John McCain]]'s running mate. She continued to be a prominent national figure even after resigning from the governor's job in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sarah-palin/ |title=Topic—Sarah Palin |newspaper=The Washington Times |accessdate=May 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525011152/http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sarah-palin/ |archive-date=May 25, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of United States Senators from Alaska|Alaska's United States senators]] belong to [[Classes of United States Senators|Class{{nbsp}}2 and Class{{nbsp}}3]]. In 2008, Democrat [[Mark Begich]], mayor of Anchorage, defeated long-time Republican senator [[Ted Stevens]]. Stevens had been convicted on seven felony counts of failing to report gifts on Senate financial discloser forms one week before the election. The conviction was set aside in April 2009 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged.

Republican [[Frank Murkowski]] held the state's other senatorial position. After being elected governor in 2002, he resigned from the Senate and appointed his daughter, State representative [[Lisa Murkowski]], as his successor. She won full six-year terms in 2004, 2010 and 2016.

{{See also|List of cities in Alaska by population|Alaska locations by per capita income|List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska}}

Alaska is not divided into [[County (United States)|counties]], as most of the other U.S. states, but it is divided into ''[[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|boroughs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.countystate.info/alaska.htm| title=Alaska Boroughs—&quot;Official&quot; sites| website=Official Borough Websites| publisher=CountyState.Info| accessdate=September 13, 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027120825/http://www.countystate.info/Alaska.htm| archive-date=October 27, 2007| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the [[Unorganized Borough, Alaska|Unorganized Borough]].

The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 [[census area]]s solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A ''recording district'' is a mechanism for administration of the [[public record]] in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State [[recorder of deeds|Recorder]]. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Whereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization—state/county/township—most of Alaska uses only two tiers—state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the [[Unorganized Borough]]. As the name implies, it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. In 2000, 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dixon|first=Mim|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=35SwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT44&amp;lpg=PT44&amp;dq=Fairbanks+has+a+separate+borough+(the+Fairbanks+North+Star+Borough)+and+municipality+(the+City+of+Fairbanks)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BCgI8dcgDn&amp;sig=ACfU3U0hPQLgZ3797_mEAj69IywLKbkzkw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiO5OG1o4boAhWEZxUIHRZABzMQ6AEwDnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Fairbanks%20has%20a%20separate%20borough%20(the%20Fairbanks%20North%20Star%20Borough)%20and%20municipality%20(the%20City%20of%20Fairbanks)&amp;f=false|title=What Happened To Fairbanks?: The Effects of the Trans-alaska Oil Pipeline on the Community Of Fairbanks, Alaska|date=September 18, 2019|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-000-01076-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian. Fairbanks has a separate borough (the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]]) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks).{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The state's most populous city is [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], home to 278,700 people in 2006, 225,744 of whom live in the urbanized area. The richest [[Alaska locations by per capita income|location in Alaska by per capita income]] is [[Halibut Cove, Alaska|Halibut Cove]] ($89,895).{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} [[Yakutat City]], Sitka, Juneau, and Anchorage are the four [[List of U.S. cities by area|largest cities in the U.S. by area]].

===Cities and census-designated places (by population)===

As reflected in the [[2010 United States Census]], Alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and [[census-designated place]]s (CDPs).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The tally of cities includes four unified municipalities, essentially the equivalent of a [[consolidated city–county]]. The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as &quot;[[The Bush (Alaska)|The Bush]]&quot; and are unconnected to the contiguous North American road network. The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.

Of Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place. Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} CDPs have not been established for these areas by the [[United States Census Bureau]], except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]] (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North [[Tongass Highway]], [[Pennock Island]] and [[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]] East), but have not been used since. The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the [[Unorganized Borough]], in largely remote areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Public health and public safety==

{{See also|Dentistry in rural Alaska}}

The [[Alaska State Troopers]] are Alaska's statewide police force. They have a long and storied history, but were not an official organization until 1941. Before the force was officially organized, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies. Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on &quot;Public Safety Officers&quot; who have police training but do not carry firearms. In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available. In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations. Due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the Troopers' duties, they employ a wide variety of land, air, and water patrol vehicles.

Some of Alaska's popular annual events are the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]] from Anchorage to Nome, World Ice Art Championships in Fairbanks, the Blueberry Festival and Alaska Hummingbird Festival in [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]], the Sitka Whale Fest, and the Stikine River Garnet Fest in [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]]. The [[Stikine River]] attracts the largest springtime concentration of [[American bald eagle]]s in the world.

The [[Alaska Native Heritage Center]] celebrates the rich heritage of Alaska's 11 cultural groups.

The [[Alaska Native Arts Foundation]] promotes and markets Native art from all regions and cultures in the State, using the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskanativearts.org|title=Alaska Native Arts Foundation|website=alaskanativearts.org|access-date=November 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717094500/http://www.alaskanativearts.org/|archive-date=July 17, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===

{{Main|Music of Alaska}}

Influences on music in Alaska include the traditional music of Alaska Natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from Russia and Europe. Prominent musicians from Alaska include singer [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], traditional Aleut flautist [[Mary Youngblood]], folk singer-songwriter [[Libby Roderick]], Christian music singer-songwriter [[Lincoln Brewster]], metal/post hardcore band [[36 Crazyfists]] and the groups [[Pamyua]] and [[Portugal. The Man]].

There are many established music festivals in Alaska, including the [[Alaska Folk Festival]], the Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival] the Anchorage Folk Festival, the [[Athabascan Old-Time Fiddling Festival]], the Sitka Jazz Festival, and the [[Sitka Summer Music Festival]]. The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the [[Anchorage Symphony Orchestra]], though the Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra and [[Juneau Symphony]] are also notable. The [[Anchorage Opera]] is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.

The official [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]] of Alaska is &quot;[[Alaska's Flag]]&quot;, which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the [[flag of Alaska]].

===Alaska in film and on television===

{{see also|List of films set in Alaska}}
[[File:Bow bow.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Films featuring Alaskan wolves usually employ domesticated [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s to stand in for wild wolves.]]

Alaska's first independent picture entirely made in Alaska was ''[[The Chechahcos]]'', produced by Alaskan businessman [[Austin E. Lathrop]] and filmed in and around Anchorage. Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made.

One of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s ''[[Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent]]'', starring Alaska Native [[Ray Mala]]. In 1932 an expedition set out from [[MGM]]'s studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as &quot;The Biggest Picture Ever Made&quot;. Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up &quot;Camp Hollywood&quot; in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming. [[Louis B. Mayer]] spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in Hollywood to prepare meals.

When ''Eskimo'' premiered at the [[Astor Theatre, New York City|Astor Theatre]] in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history. ''Eskimo'' was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star. ''Eskimo'' won the first Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the Academy Awards, and showcased and preserved aspects of [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] culture on film.

The 1983 Disney movie ''[[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Never Cry Wolf]]'' was at least partially shot in Alaska. The 1991 film ''[[White Fang (1991 film)|White Fang]]'', based on [[Jack London]]'s novel and starring [[Ethan Hawke]], was filmed in and around [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]. [[Steven Seagal]]'s 1994 ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'', starring [[Michael Caine]], was filmed in part at the [[Worthington Glacier]] near [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/OnDeadlyGround/ |title=On Deadly Ground |publisher=Filminamerica.com |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227140459/http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/OnDeadlyGround/ |archive-date=December 27, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 [[John Sayles]] film ''[[Limbo (1999 film)|Limbo]]'', starring [[David Strathairn]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]], was filmed in Juneau.

The psychological thriller ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'', starring [[Al Pacino]] and [[Robin Williams]], was shot in Canada, but was set in Alaska. The 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, ''[[Into the Wild (film)|Into The Wild]]'', was partially filmed and set in Alaska. The film, which is based on the novel of the same name, follows the adventures of [[Christopher McCandless]], who died in a remote abandoned bus along the [[Stampede Trail]] west of [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] in 1992.

Many films and television shows set in Alaska are not filmed there; for example, ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', set in the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, was filmed in [[Roslyn, Washington]]. The 2007 horror feature ''[[30 Days of Night (film)|30 Days of Night]]'' is set in [[Utqiagvik, Alaska|Barrow, Alaska]]{{refn|group=note|name=namechange|now known as Utqiagvik}}, but was filmed in New Zealand.

Many reality television shows are filmed in Alaska. In 2011 the ''Anchorage Daily News'' found ten set in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;hopkins20110214&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/2011/02/14/1699528/alaska-based-shows-what-do-the.html |title=Rating the Alaska reality shows: The best and the worst |work=Anchorage Daily News |date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |author=Hopkins, Kyle |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302051556/http://www.adn.com/2011/02/14/1699528/alaska-based-shows-what-do-the.html |archivedate=March 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agriculture''' is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Office1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Safety and health in agriculture |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=GtBa6XIW_aQC|page=77}} |year=1999 |publisher=International Labour Organization |isbn=978-92-2-111517-5 |page=77 |accessdate=13 September 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722061757/http://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC |archivedate=22 July 2011|quote=defined agriculture as 'all forms of activities connected with growing, harvesting and primary processing of all types of crops, with the breeding, raising and caring for animals, and with tending gardens and nurseries'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture was the key development in the rise of [[sedentism|sedentary]] [[human civilization]], whereby farming of [[domestication|domesticated]] species created food [[economic surplus|surpluses]] that enabled people to live in cities. The [[history of agriculture]] began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. [[Industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people still depended on [[subsistence agriculture]] into the twenty-first.

Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s, and technological developments have sharply increased yields, while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in [[animal husbandry]] have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to [[global warming]], depletion of [[aquifer]]s, [[deforestation]], [[antibiotic resistance]], and [[growth hormone]]s in [[industrial meat production]]. [[Genetically modified organism]]s are widely used, although some are banned in certain countries.

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, [[fuel]]s and [[raw material]]s (such as [[natural rubber|rubber]]). Food classes include [[cereal]]s ([[grains]]), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[cooking oil|oils]], [[meat]], [[milk]], [[edible mushroom|fungi]] and [[eggs as food|eggs]]. Over one-third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the [[service sector]], although the number of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the centuries.

Scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from [[hunter-gatherer]] to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing [[sedentism]]; examples are the [[Natufian culture]] in the [[Levant]], and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China.

[[File:Reindeer herding.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reindeer]] herds form the basis of pastoral agriculture for several Arctic and Subarctic peoples.]]

[[Pastoralism]] involves managing domesticated animals. In [[nomadic pastoralism]], herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture, fodder, and water. This type of farming is practised in arid and semi-arid regions of [[Sahara]], [[Central Asia]] and some parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Blench | first=Roger | title=Pastoralists in the new millennium | publisher=FAO | date=2001 | pages=11–12 | url=http://www.odi.org.uk/work/projects/pdn/eps.pdf | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201000745/http://www.odi.org.uk/work/projects/pdn/eps.pdf | archivedate=1 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[shifting cultivation]], a small area of forest is cleared by cutting and burning the trees. The cleared land is used for growing crops for a few years until the soil becomes too infertile, and the area is abandoned. Another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated. This type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly. This practice is used in Northeast India, Southeast Asia, and the Amazon Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shifting cultivation |url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/swidden |publisher=[[Survival International]] |accessdate=28 August 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829015112/http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/swidden |archivedate=29 August 2016| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crop cultivation systems ===
[[File:An example of slash and burn agriculture practice Thailand.jpg|thumb|left|[[Slash and burn]] shifting cultivation, Thailand]]

Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO FS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |url=http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/description_en.htm |title=Analysis of farming systems |accessdate=22 May 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806063804/http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/description_en.htm |archivedate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP APS&quot;&gt;&quot;Agricultural Production Systems&quot;. pp. 283–317 in [[#Acquaah|Acquaah]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Shifting cultivation (or [[slash and burn]]) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then [[perennial plant|perennial]] crops for a period of several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;&gt;&quot;Farming Systems: Development, Productivity, and Sustainability&quot;, pp. 25–57 in [[#Chrispeels|Chrispeels]]&lt;/ref&gt; Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or [[manure]]) and some manual [[pest control]]. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Intercropping coconut n Tagetes erecta.jpg|thumb|[[Intercropping]] of [[coconut]] and [[Tagetes erecta|Mexican marigold]]]]

Further industrialization led to the use of [[monoculture]]s, when one [[cultivar]] is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low [[biodiversity]], nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of [[pesticide]]s and fertilizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP APS&quot; /&gt; [[Multiple cropping]], in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and [[intercropping]], when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as [[polyculture]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot; /&gt;

In [[subtropics|subtropical]] and [[arid]] environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring irrigation. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry. In [[Temperateness|temperate]] environments, where ecosystems were predominantly [[grassland]] or [[prairie]], highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot; /&gt;

Important categories of food crops include [[cereal]]s, legumes, forage, fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO&quot; /&gt; [[Natural fiber]]s include [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], [[silk]] and [[flax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profiles of 15 of the world's major plant and animal fibres|url=http://www.fao.org/natural-fibres-2009/about/15-natural-fibres/en/|publisher=FAO|accessdate=26 March 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific crops are cultivated in distinct [[growing region]]s throughout the world.

=== Livestock production systems ===

Animal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat, milk, [[egg (food)|eggs]], or [[wool]], and for work and transport.&lt;ref name=Clutton-Brock&gt;{{cite book |author=Clutton-Brock, Juliet |title=A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=cgL-EbbB8a0C|page=1}} |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-63495-3 |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Working animal]]s, including horses, [[mule]]s, [[ox]]en, [[water buffalo]], [[camel]]s, llamas, alpacas, [[donkey]]s, and [[dog]]s, have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields, [[harvest]] crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Falvey | first=John Lindsay | authorlink=Lindsay Falvey | year=1985 | title=Introduction to Working Animals | isbn=978-1-86252-992-2 | location=Melbourne, Australia | publisher=MPW Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as grassland-based, mixed, and landless.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sere, C. |author2=Steinfeld, H. |author3=Groeneweld, J. |year=1995 |url=http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6101E/x6101e00.htm#Contents|title=Description of Systems in World Livestock Systems – Current status issues and trends |publisher=U.N.

Between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite journal |title=Livestock production: recent trends, future prospects |author=Thornton, Philip K. |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0134 |pmid=20713389 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |date=27 September 2010 |volume=365 |issue=1554 |pages=2853–2867 |doi-access=free |df=dmy-all|pmc=2935116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aquaculture]] or fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html |title=Fish Farming's Growing Dangers |journal=Time |author=Stier, Ken |date=19 September 2007|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907071708/http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html |archivedate=7 September 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 20th century, producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock [[breed]]s and [[crossbreed]]s that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve [[genetic diversity]]. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A global view of livestock biodiversity and conservation – Globaldiv |author=Ajmone-Marsan, P. |journal=Animal Genetics |date=May 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02036.x |pmid=20500752 |volume=41 |issue=supplement S1 |pages=1–5 |url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/148417 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803140941/https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/148417 |archivedate=3 August 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Broiler house.jpg|thumb|Raising [[chicken]]s intensively for meat in a broiler house]]

Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as [[shrubland]], [[rangeland]], and [[managed intensive rotational grazing|pastures]] for feeding [[ruminant]] animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot; /&gt; Mixed production systems use grassland, [[fodder]] crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot; /&gt;

Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot; /&gt; Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in [[confined animal feeding operations]], sometimes called [[factory farming]]. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa.&lt;ref name=LP /&gt; Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of [[growth hormone]]s, are controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |title=Growth Promoting Hormones Pose Health Risk to Consumers, Confirms EU Scientific Committee |date=23 April 2002 |accessdate=6 April 2013 |publisher=European Union |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502123053/http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production practices ===
[[File:Fendt Tractor Ripping up Kulin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tillage|Tilling]] an arable field]]
{{see|Tillage|Crop rotation|Irrigation}}

Tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or [[harrow (tool)|harrow]] to prepare for planting, for nutrient incorporation, or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to [[no-till farming|no-till]]. It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soil nutrient&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Tillage&quot;&gt;&quot;Land Preparation and Farm Energy&quot;, pp. 318–338 in [[#Acquaah|Acquaah]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pest control includes the management of weeds, [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, and diseases. Chemical (pesticides), biological ([[biocontrol]]), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include crop rotation, [[culling]], [[cover crop]]s, intercropping, [[compost]]ing, avoidance, and [[Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|resistance]]. Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Pest&quot;&gt;&quot;Pesticide Use in U.S. Crop Production&quot;, pp. 240–282 in [[#Acquaah|Acquaah]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nutrient management]] includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of manure produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, manure, [[green manure]], compost and [[mineral]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Soil&quot;&gt;&quot;Soil and Land&quot;, pp. 165–210 in [[#Acquaah|Acquaah]]&lt;/ref&gt; Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a [[fallow]] period. Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, or [[Manure spreader|by spreading]] either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or [[pasture]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS nutrient&quot;&gt;&quot;Nutrition from the Soil&quot;, pp. 187–218 in [[#Chrispeels|Chrispeels]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soil nutrient&quot;&gt;Brady, N.

According to a report by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]], agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, the International Food Policy Research Institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.&lt;ref name=ifpri&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifpri.org/publication/food-security-world-natural-resource-scarcity |author=International Food Policy Research Institute |title=Food Security in a World of Growing Natural Resource Scarcity |year=2014 |publisher=CropLife International |accessdate=1 July 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305043943/http://www.ifpri.org/publication/food-security-world-natural-resource-scarcity |archivedate=5 March 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wheat selection k10183-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wheat]] cultivar tolerant of high [[salinity]] (left) compared with non-tolerant variety]]

Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist [[Gregor Mendel]]. His work on [[dominant allele|dominant]] and [[recessive allele]]s, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, [[self-pollination]] and [[cross-pollination]], and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |title=History of Plant Breeding |date=29 January 2004 |publisher=Colorado State University |accessdate=11 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121061931/http://cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |archivedate=21 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance and [[drought tolerance]], eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in [[New Zealand]]. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stadler |first=L.

The [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] to sharply increase yield by creating &quot;high-yielding varieties&quot;. For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the US have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruttan |first=Vernon W. |title=Biotechnology and Agriculture: A Skeptical Perspective |journal=AgBioForum |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=54–60 |date=December 1999 |url=http://www.agbioforum.org/v2n1/v2n1a10-ruttan.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521021149/http://www.agbioforum.org/v2n1/v2n1a10-ruttan.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cassman |first=K. |title=Ecological intensification of cereal production systems: The Challenge of increasing crop yield potential and precision agriculture |journal=Proceedings of a National Academy of Sciences Colloquium, Irvine, California |date=5 December 1998 |url=http://www.lsc.psu.edu/nas/Speakers/Cassman%20manuscript.html |accessdate=11 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024001804/http://www.lsc.psu.edu/nas/Speakers/Cassman%20manuscript.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conversion note: 1 bushel of wheat=60&amp;nbsp;pounds (lb) ≈ 27.215&amp;nbsp;kg. 1 bushel of maize=56&amp;nbsp;pounds ≈ 25.401&amp;nbsp;kg&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including [[glyphosate]]. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop.

=== Effects and costs ===
[[File:Water pollution in the Wairarapa.JPG|upright|thumb|left|[[Water pollution]] in a rural [[stream]] due to [[Agricultural pollution in New Zealand|runoff from farming activity in New Zealand]]]]

Agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature (especially herbicides and insecticides), nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, and loss of natural environment. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pretty |year=2000 |title=An assessment of the total external costs of UK agriculture |journal=Agricultural Systems |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=113–136 |doi=10.1016/S0308-521X(00)00031-7 |first1=J. |display-authors=1 |last2=Brett |first2=C. |last3=Gee |first3=D. |last4=Hine |first4=R.

Neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tegtmeier2005 /&gt;

Agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs. Yield increases with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens, predators, and competitors (such as weeds). Costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units, such as making fields larger; this means removing [[hedge]]s, ditches and other areas of habitat. Pesticides kill insects, plants and fungi. These and other measures have cut biodiversity to very low levels on intensively farmed land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richards |first1=A. J. |title=Does Low Biodiversity Resulting from Modern Agricultural Practice Affect Crop Pollination and Yield? |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2001 |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=165–172 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2001.1463|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]] of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] assessed the environmental impacts of consumption and production. It found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions. Agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment, including insecticides, especially those used on cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/PriorityProducts/tabid/56053/Default.aspx |title=Priority products and materials: assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production |author=International Resource Panel |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |year=2010 |accessdate=7 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224061455/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/PriorityProducts/tabid/56053/Default.aspx |archivedate=24 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report states that &quot;[a]agricultural operations, excluding land use changes, produce approximately 13 per cent of anthropogenic global GHG emissions. This includes GHGs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilizers agro-chemical pesticides and herbicides; (GHG emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions); and fossil fuel-energy inputs.&lt;ref name=&quot;unep.org&quot;&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, https://www.unenvironment.org/search/node?keys=Towards+a+Green+Economy%3A+Pathways+to+Sustainable+Development+and+Poverty+Eradication&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;On average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for second- generation biofuel production amounts to 3.8 billion tonnes per year between 2011 and 2050 (with an average annual growth rate of 11 per cent throughout the period analysed, accounting for higher growth during early years, 48 per cent for 2011–2020 and an average 2 per cent annual expansion after 2020).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;unep.org&quot; /&gt;

=== Livestock issues ===
[[File:Biogas.jpg|thumb|Farmyard [[anaerobic digester]] converts waste plant material and manure from livestock into [[biogas]] fuel.]]

A senior UN official, Henning Steinfeld, said that &quot;Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html |title=Livestock a major threat to environment |publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |date=29 November 2006 |accessdate=24 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328062709/http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html |archivedate=28 March 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet. It is one of the largest sources of [[greenhouse gas]]es, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It produces 65% of human-related [[nitrous oxide]] (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt;) and 37% of all human-induced [[methane]] (which is 23 times as warming as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.) It also generates 64% of the [[ammonia]] emission. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving [[deforestation]]; in the Amazon basin 70% of [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|previously forested area]] is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops.&lt;ref name=&quot;LEAD&quot;&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625012113/http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2008 |last1=Steinfeld |first1=H. |last2=Gerber |first2=P. |last3=Wassenaar |first3=T. |last4=Castel |first4=V. |last5=Rosales |first5=M. |last6=de Haan |first6=C. |year=2006 |publisher=U.N.

Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from [[fossil fuel]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/world-oil-supplies-are-set-to-run-out-faster-than-expected-warn-scientists-453068.html |title=World oil supplies are set to run out faster than expected, warn scientists |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021233714/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/world-oil-supplies-are-set-to-run-out-faster-than-expected-warn-scientists-453068.html |archivedate=21 October 2010 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=14 June 2007 |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1960s and the 1980s, the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Future of the Green Revolution: Implications for International Grain Markets |author=Herdt, Robert W. |url=http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/uploads/files/06132caf-3d72-49e4-817d-ae89e0249d18.pdf |publisher=The Rockefeller Foundation|date=30 May 1997 |accessdate=16 April 2013 |page=2 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019153636/http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/uploads/files/06132caf-3d72-49e4-817d-ae89e0249d18.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[world population]] doubled.

This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of [[value added|value addition]] (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. [[Market concentration]] has increased in the sector as well, and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute [[economic surplus]] from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.&lt;ref name=Sexton2000&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sexton, R.

National government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products, in the form of taxation, [[Subsidy|subsidies]], tariffs and other measures.&lt;ref name=LloydCroserAnderson2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1 |title=How Do Agricultural Policy Restrictions to Global Trade and Welfare Differ across Commodities? |author1=Lloyd, Peter J. |author2=Croser, Johanna L. |author3=Anderson, Kym |website=Policy Research Working Paper #4864 |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=16 April 2013 |date=March 2009 |pages=2–3 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605125346/https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since at least the 1960s, a combination of trade restrictions, [[exchange rate policy|exchange rate policies]] and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and the developed world. In the 1980s, non-subsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8699/wps3901.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Do Global Trade Distortions Still Harm Developing Country Farmers? |author1=Anderson, Kym |author2=Valenzuela, Ernesto |website=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3901 |date=April 2006 |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=16 April 2013 |pages=1–2 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605145451/https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8699/wps3901.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=5 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, {{as of|2009|lc=y}}, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the [[oilseed]]s, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.&lt;ref name=LloydCroserAnderson2013 /&gt; Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/24/american-cotton-subsidies-illegal-obama-must-act |title=America's $24bn subsidy damages developing world cotton farmers |author=Kinnock, Glenys |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=16 April 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906122834/http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/24/american-cotton-subsidies-illegal-obama-must-act |archivedate=6 September 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unprocessed commodities such as corn, soybeans, and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality, affecting the price the producer receives.

[[Agricultural policy]] is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), [[economic stability]] (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and [[environmental sustainability]] (especially [[water resource management|water policy]]), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |page=13 |title=Agricultural and food policy choices in Australia |journal=Sustainable Agriculture and Food Policy in the 21st Century: Challenges and Solutions |date=October 2010 |accessdate=22 April 2013 |author1=Hogan, Lindsay |author2=Morris, Paul |url=http://coserve.com.au/PDF/VirtualMeeting/ABARE-Agric_food_policy_CONFERENCE_PAPER-2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural policy can also touch on [[food quality]], ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://europa.eu/european-union/topics/agriculture_en |title=Agriculture: Not Just Farming |publisher=European Union |accessdate=8 May 2018 |date=2016-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. [[Agribusiness]] interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of [[lobbying]] and [[campaign contribution]]s. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and [[labor union]]s, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://faculty.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-Corporatization%20of%20Fm%20Pol%20(9-10).htm |title=Corporatization of Agricultural Policy |author=Ikerd, John |journal=Small Farm Today Magazine |year=2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807024012/http://faculty.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-Corporatization%20of%20Fm%20Pol%20(9-10).htm |archivedate=7 August 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Dr. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/22/food-firms-lobbying-samuel-jutzi |title=Corporate Lobbying Is Blocking Food Reforms, Senior UN Official Warns: Farming Summit Told of Delaying Tactics by Large Agribusiness and Food Producers on Decisions that Would Improve Human Health and the Environment |author=Jowit, Juliette |date=22 September 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aldous Leonard Huxley''' (26 July 1894 – 22 November 1963) was an English writer and philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley |editor-last=Watt |editor-first=Donald |publisher=Routledge |date=1975 |isbn=978-0-415-15915-9 |page=366 |quote=Inge's agreement with Huxley on several essential points indicates the respect Huxley's position commanded from some important philosophers … And now we have a book by Aldous Huxley, duly labelled ''The Perennial Philosophy''. … He is now quite definitely a mystical philosopher. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8PHKq723vpUC&amp;pg=PA366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley and the Search for Meaning: A Study of the Eleven Novels |last=Sion |first=Ronald T. |date=2010 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. |isbn=978-0-7864-4746-6 |page=2 |quote=Aldous Huxley, as a writer of fiction in the 20th century, willingly assumes the role of a modern philosopher-king or literary prophet by examining the essence of what it means to be human in the modern age. … Huxley was a prolific genius who was always searching throughout his life for an understanding of self and one's place within the universe. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=77ithOrxlgMC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley: Brave New World |last=Reiff |first=Raychel Haugrud |year=2010 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation |isbn=978-0-7614-4278-3 |page=7 |quote=He was also a philosopher, mystic, social prophet, political thinker, and world traveler who had a detailed knowledge of music, medicine, science, technology, history, literature and Eastern religions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley: A Biography |last=Sawyer |first=Dana |publisher=The Crossroad Publishing Company |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8245-1987-2 |page=187 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_uIdAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=aldous+huxley+philosopher&amp;dq=aldous+huxley+philosopher|accessdate=10 April 2016 |quote=Huxley was a philosopher but his viewpoint was not determined by the intellect alone.

Born into the prominent [[Huxley family]], he graduated from [[Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] with an undergraduate degree in English literature. Early in his career, he published short stories and poetry and edited the literary magazine ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'', before going on to publish travel writing, satire, and [[screenplays]]. He spent the latter part of his life in the United States, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/8751943/The-Britons-who-made-their-mark-on-LA.html |title=The Britons who made their mark on LA |date=11 September 2011 |access-date=5 July 2018  |issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of his life, Huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the foremost intellectuals of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Thody, Philipe (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] seven times&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=4397 &quot;Nomination Database: Aldous Huxley&quot;].

&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was a [[pacifist]]. He grew interested in philosophical [[mysticism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thody |first=Philipe |title=Huxley: A Biographical Introduction |year=1973 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=978-0-289-70188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David K.

In his most famous novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) and his final novel ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), he presented his vision of [[dystopia]] and [[utopia]], respectively.

Huxley was born in [[Godalming]], Surrey, England, in 1894. He was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]], who edited ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.nls.uk/jma/topics/publishing/cornhill.html |title=Cornhill Magazine |website=National Library of Scotland |access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his first wife, Julia Arnold, who founded [[Prior's Field School]]. Julia was the niece of poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] and the sister of [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mrs. Humphry Ward]]. Aldous was the grandson of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the [[Zoology|zoologist]], agnostic, and controversialist (&quot;Darwin's Bulldog&quot;). His brother [[Julian Huxley]] and half-brother [[Andrew Huxley]] also became outstanding biologists. Aldous had another brother, Noel Trevenen Huxley (1889–1914), who took his own life after a period of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Charles Mason (1978) ''Aldous Huxley and the Way to Reality.'' Greenwood Press, 1978, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Huxley's nickname was &quot;Ogie&quot;, short for &quot;Ogre&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley |last=Bedford |first=Sybille |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf / Harper &amp; Row |year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described by his brother, Julian, as someone who frequently &quot;[contemplated] the strangeness of things&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; According to his cousin and contemporary, Gervas Huxley, he had an early interest in drawing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Huxley's education began in his father's well-equipped botanical laboratory, after which he enrolled at Hillside School near [[Godalming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hull2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hull |first=James |title=Aldous Huxley, Representative Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bX3EAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |year=2004 |publisher=LIT Verlag Münster |isbn=978-3-8258-7663-0 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rintoul2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=M.C.

After Hillside he went on to [[Eton College]]. His mother died in 1908, when he was 14 (his [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|father]] later remarried). {{anchor|Aldous Huxley eye disease}}He contracted the eye disease [[Keratitis punctata]] in 1911; this &quot;left [him] practically blind for two to three years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huxley |first=Aldous |year=1939 |chapter=Biography and bibliography (appendix) |title=After Many A Summer Dies The Swan |series=1st Perennial Classic |page=243 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;ended his early dreams of becoming a doctor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Brave New World |last=Huxley |first=Aldous |publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics / HarperCollins Publishers |year=2006 |chapter=Aldous Huxley: A Life of the Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1913, Huxley entered [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he studied English literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff&quot; /&gt; He volunteered for the [[British Army]] in January 1916, for the [[World War I|Great War]]; however, he was rejected on health grounds, being half-blind in one eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff&quot;&gt;Raychel Haugrud Reiff (2009). &quot;Aldous Huxley: Brave New World&quot;. p. 112. Marshall Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt; His eyesight later partly recovered. He edited ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'' in 1916, and in June of that year graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] with [[British undergraduate degree classification#First Class Honours|first class honours]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff&quot; /&gt; His brother Julian wrote:

{{Quote|I believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise. For one thing, it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career&amp;nbsp;... His uniqueness lay in his universalism. He was able to take all knowledge for his province.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Huxley 1965. ''Aldous Huxley 1894–1963: a Memorial Volume''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following his years at Balliol, Huxley, being financially indebted to his father, decided to find employment. He taught French for a year at [[Eton College]], where Eric Blair (who was to take the pen name [[George Orwell]]) and [[Steven Runciman]] were among his pupils. He was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class. Nevertheless, Blair and others spoke highly of his excellent command of language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crick&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Crick |first=Bernard |title=George Orwell: A Life |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-14-014563-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significantly, Huxley also worked for a time during the 1920s at [[Tata Chemicals Europe|Brunner and Mond]], an advanced chemical plant in [[Billingham]] in County Durham, northeast England. According to the introduction to the latest edition of his science fiction novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932), the experience he had there of &quot;an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence&quot; was an important source for the novel.

== Career ==
[[File:Aldous Huxley 1927.png|thumb|left|upright|Painting of Huxley in 1927 by [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]]]]
Huxley completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early twenties, establishing himself as a successful writer and social satirist. His first published novels were social satires, ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921), ''[[Antic Hay]]'' (1923), ''[[Those Barren Leaves]]'' (1925), and ''[[Point Counter Point]]'' (1928). ''Brave New World'' was his fifth novel and first dystopian work. In the 1920s he was also a contributor to ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]]'' and [[Vogue (British magazine)|British ''Vogue'']] magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley: Selected Letters&quot;. p. 144. Ivan R. Dee, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contact with the Bloomsbury Set ===
[[File:SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: [[Bloomsbury Group]] members [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], Maria Nys, [[Lytton Strachey]], [[Duncan Grant]], and [[Vanessa Bell]]]]
During the First World War, Huxley spent much of his time at [[Garsington Manor]] near Oxford, home of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], working as a farm labourer. There he met several [[Bloomsbury Group]] figures, including [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Weber |first=Michel |author-link=Michel Weber |url=https://www.academia.edu/3268912 |title=On Religiousness and Religion.

A Journal of Twentieth-Century Thought and Beyond |volume=5 |place=Münster |publisher=LIT |date=March 2005 |pages=117–32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clive Bell]]. Later, in ''Crome Yellow'' (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. Jobs were very scarce, but in 1919 [[John Middleton Murry]] was reorganising the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' and invited Huxley to join the staff. He accepted immediately, and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys, also at Garsington.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Huxleys |first=Ronald W |last=Clark |publisher=William Heinemann |place=London |year=1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They lived with their young son in Italy part of the time during the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Following Lawrence's death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Woodcock |year=2007 |title=Dawn and the Darkest Hour: A Study of Aldous Huxley |page=240 |publisher=Black Rose Books}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''Brave New World'', and on pacifist themes (for example, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza (novel)|Eyeless in Gaza]]''). In ''Brave New World'', set in a [[dystopia]]n London, Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian conditioning]]. Huxley was strongly influenced by [[F. Matthias Alexander]], and included him as a character in ''Eyeless in Gaza''.

Beginning in this period, Huxley began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including ''[[Ends and Means]]'', ''An Encyclopedia of Pacifism'', and ''Pacifism and Philosophy'', and was an active member of the [[Peace Pledge Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |publisher=Peace Pledge Union |title=Aldous Huxley |accessdate=15 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606072731/http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |archivedate=6 June 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life in the United States ===
In 1937 Huxley moved to Hollywood with his wife Maria, son [[Matthew Huxley]], and friend [[Gerald Heard]]. He lived in the U.S., mainly in southern California, until his death, and also for a time in [[Taos, New Mexico]], where he wrote ''[[Ends and Means]]'' (published in 1937). The book contains tracts on war, religion, nationalism and ethics.

Heard introduced Huxley to [[Vedanta]] ([[Upanishads|Upanishad-centered philosophy]]), meditation, and vegetarianism through the principle of [[ahimsa]]. In 1938, Huxley befriended [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired. Huxley and Krishnamurti entered into an enduring exchange (sometimes edging on debate) over many years, with Krishnamurti representing the more rarefied, detached, ivory-tower perspective and Huxley, with his pragmatic concerns, the more socially and historically informed position. Huxley provided an introduction to Krishnamurti's quintessential statement, ''The First and Last Freedom'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, Roland (2000) ''Star in the East'', pp. 204–207. Sentient Publications: Boulder, CO&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley also became a Vedantist in the circle of [[Hindu]] [[Swami Prabhavananda]], and introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle. Not long afterward, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world. Huxley's book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted &quot;five senses&quot; and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities.

Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of [[Occidental College]]. He spent much time at the college, which is in the [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] neighbourhood of Los Angeles. The college appears as &quot;Tarzana College&quot; in his satirical novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' (1939). The novel won Huxley a British literary award, the 1939 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Haugrud Reiff, Raychel (2003) ''Aldous Huxley: Brave New World'' p. 103. Marshall Cavendish, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.

During this period, Huxley earned a substantial income as a Hollywood screenwriter; [[Christopher Isherwood]], in his autobiography ''My Guru and His Disciple'', states that Huxley earned more than $3,000 per week (approximately $50,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=$3,000 in 1937 → 2020 {{!}} Inflation Calculator|url=https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1937?amount=3000|website=www.in2013dollars.com|access-date=23 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2020 dollars) as a screenwriter, and that he used much of it to transport Jewish and left-wing writer and artist refugees from Hitler's Germany to the US. In March 1938, Huxley's friend [[Anita Loos]], a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), which hired him for ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'' which was originally to star [[Greta Garbo]] and be directed by [[George Cukor]]. (Eventually, the film was completed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and cast.) Huxley received screen credit for ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1944). He was commissioned by [[Walt Disney]] in 1945 to write a script based on ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and the biography of the story's author, [[Lewis Carroll]]. The script was not used, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/2010/04/15/mcsweeneys_intellectual_screenplays/ |title=7 unproduced screenplays by famous intellectuals |date=15 April 2010 |work=Salon |access-date=25 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of [[J. D. Unwin]]'s 1940 book ''Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=JD |last=Unwin |title=Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society |year=1940 |publisher=Oscar Piest |place=NY}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to George Orwell, author of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', congratulating him on &quot;how fine and how profoundly important the book is.&quot; In his letter to Orwell, he predicted:
{{Quote | Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and [[wikt:narcohypnosis|narcohypnosis]] are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Huxley |first=Aldous |editor=Grover Smith |title=Letters of Aldous Huxley |url=https://archive.org/details/lettersofaldoush0000unse |url-access=registration |year=1969 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |location=London |isbn=978-0-7011-1312-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself. From these, he made some warnings in his writings and talks. In a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist [[Mike Wallace]], Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to persuasion; the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as well-marketed commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePNGa0m3XA |title=The Mike Wallace Interview: Aldous Huxley (18 May 1958) |via=YouTube |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall semester of 1960, Huxley was invited by Professor [[Huston Smith]] to be the Carnegie Visiting Professor of Humanities at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=3 January 2017|first=Barry|last=Boyce|magazine=[[Lion's Roar (magazine)|Lion's Roar]]|url=https://www.lionsroar.com/huston-smith-fifty-years-on-the-razors-edge|title=Huston Smith’s Fifty Years on the Razor’s Edge
|accessdate=13 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the MIT centennial program of events organised by the Department of Humanities, Huxley presented a series of lectures titled, &quot;What a Piece of Work is a Man&quot; which concerned history, language, and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archivesspace.mit.edu/repositories/2/resources/761|title=Aldous Huxley lecture series, &quot;What a Piece of Work Is a Man&quot;|website=archivesspace.mit.edu|url-status=live|access-date=27 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-World War II life ===
In 1953, Huxley and Maria applied for [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizenship]] and presented themselves for examination. When Huxley refused to bear arms for the U.S. and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals, the only excuse allowed under the [[McCarran Internal Security Act|McCarran Act]], the judge had to adjourn the proceedings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Raychel Haugrud Reiff|title=Aldous Huxley: Brave New World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8JyRntokmqYC&amp;pg=PA31|date=1 September 2009|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-4701-6|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Nicholas|title=Aldous Huxley: An English Intellectual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7h7CKgXGDi4C&amp;pg=PT309|date=4 June 2009|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-0-7481-1231-9|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew his application. Nevertheless, he remained in the U.S. In 1959 Huxley turned down an offer of a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Harold Macmillan#Prime Minister (1957–1963)|Macmillan government]] without putting forward a reason; his brother Julian had been knighted in 1958, while another brother Andrew would be knighted in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica''. (2003). Volume 6. p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

== Association with Vedanta ==
Beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963, Huxley had an extensive association with the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]], founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with Gerald Heard, Christopher Isherwood and other followers, he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.{{sfn|Roy|2003}}

In 1944, Huxley wrote the introduction to the &quot;Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;IsherwoodSwami Prabhavananda1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isherwood |first1=Christopher |last2=Swami Prabhavananda |last3=Aldous |first3=Huxley |title=Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God |year=1987 |publisher=Vedanta Press |location=Hollywood, Calif |isbn=978-0-87481-043-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated by Swami Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwood, which was published by the Vedanta Society of Southern California.

From 1941 until 1960, Huxley contributed 48 articles to ''Vedanta and the West'', published by the society. He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood, Heard, and playwright [[John Van Druten]] from 1951 through 1962.

Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples. Two of those lectures have been released on CD: ''[[Knowledge and Understanding]]'' and ''[[Who Are We? (album)|Who Are We?]]'' from 1955. Nonetheless, Huxley's agnosticism, together with his speculative propensity, made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of institutionalised religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Weber]], &quot; [https://www.academia.edu/1564486/_Perennial_Truth_and_Perpetual_Perishing._A._Huxleys_Worldview_in_the_Light_of_A._N._Whiteheads_Process_Philosophy_of_Time_2007_ Perennial Truth and Perpetual Perishing.

== Psychedelic drug use and mystical experiences==
{{See also|The Doors of Perception}}
In the spring of 1953, Huxley had his first experience with the [[psychedelic drug]] [[mescaline]]. Huxley had initiated a correspondence with Doctor [[Humphry Osmond]], a British psychiatrist then employed in a Canadian institution, and eventually asked him to supply a dose of mescaline; Osmond obliged and supervised Huxley's session in southern California. After the publication of ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', in which he recounted this experience, Huxley and Swami Prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience, which may have caused the relationship to cool, but Huxley continued to write articles for the society's journal, lecture at the temple, and attend social functions. Huxley later had an [[The Doors of Perception#Later experience|experience on mescaline]] that he considered more profound than those detailed in ''The Doors of Perception''.

Huxley wrote that &quot;The mystical experience is doubly valuable; it is valuable because it gives the experiencer a better understanding of himself and the world and because it may help him to lead a less self-centered and more creative life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, &quot;Moksha: Aldous Huxley's Classic Writings on Psychedelics and the Visionary Experience&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eyesight ==
[[File:Aldous Huxley 1947.png|thumb|upright|Huxley in 1947, his right eye affected by [[Keratitis]] he contracted in 1911]]
Differing accounts exist about the details of the quality of Huxley's eyesight at specific points in his life. Circa 1939, Huxley encountered the [[Bates method]] for better eyesight, and a teacher, [[Margaret Darst Corbett]], who was able to teach the method to him. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} ''ranchito'' in the high desert hamlet of [[Llano, California]], in northern [[Los Angeles County]]. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that, for the first time in more than 25 years, he was able to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'', which was published in 1942 (U.S.), 1943 (UK). The book contained some generally disputed theories, and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxley's eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley Annual |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYFcahCQm4wC&amp;pg=PA109 |publisher=LIT Verlag Münster |date=28 February 2011 |isbn=978-3-643-10450-2 |language=en |first=Bernfried |last=Nugel |first2=Jerome |last2=Meckier |page=111 |chapter=A New Look at The Art of Seeing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, and is, widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since [[#Aldous Huxley eye disease|the illness in his teens]], despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at Oxford. For example, some ten years after publication of ''The Art of Seeing'', in 1952, [[Bennett Cerf]] was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: &quot;Then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonising moment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot;&gt;Cerf, Bennett (12 April 1952), ''The Saturday Review'' (column), quoted in {{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Gardner |title=Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science |year=1957 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-20394-2|title-link=Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian author [[João Ubaldo Ribeiro]], who as a young journalist spent several evenings in the Huxleys' company in the late 1950s, wrote that Huxley had said to him, with a wry smile, &quot;I can hardly see at all. And I don't give a damn, really&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=O Conselheiro Come |publisher=Editora Nova Fronteira |date=2000 |isbn=978-85-209-1069-6 |language=pt |page=[https://archive.org/details/oconselheirocome00ribe/page/92 92] |url=https://archive.org/details/oconselheirocome00ribe/page/92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Huxley's second wife, [[Laura Huxley|Laura Archera]], later emphasised in her biographical account, ''This Timeless Moment'': &quot;One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight&quot;. After revealing a letter she wrote to the ''Los Angeles Times'' disclaiming the label of Huxley as a &quot;poor fellow who can hardly see&quot; by [[Walter C. Alvarez]], she tempered her statement with, &quot;Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision. For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Huxley |first=Laura |title=This Timeless Moment |url=https://archive.org/details/thistimelessmome00huxl |url-access=registration |year=1968 |publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux |location=New York |isbn=978-0-89087-968-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley's vision. Her account, in this respect, agrees with the following sample of Huxley's own words from ''The Art of Seeing'': &quot;The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable&quot;. Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley's eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, Lionel (1981) ''Literary LA'' p. 50. Chronicle Books, 1981. University of California.&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[popular science]] author [[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]], in his book ''Mind Wide Open'', quotes Huxley about his difficulties with [[Encoding (memory)#Visual encoding|visual encoding]]: &quot;I am and, for as long as I can remember, I have always been a poor visualizer. Words, even the pregnant words of poets, [[Aphantasia|do not evoke pictures in my mind]]. No hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep. When I recall something, the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or object. By an effort of the will, I can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon&amp;nbsp;...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, ''The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell'', Harper Perennial, 1963, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Johnson (author) |title=Mind Wide Open: Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life |location=New York |publisher=Scribner |year=2004 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mindwideopen00stev/page/235 235] |isbn=978-0-7432-4165-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/mindwideopen00stev/page/235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Huxley married Maria Nys (10 September 1899 – 12 February 1955), a Belgian he met at [[Garsington]], Oxfordshire, in 1919. They had one child, [[Matthew Huxley]] (19 April 1920 – 10 February 2005), who had a career as an author, anthropologist, and prominent [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31009-2005Feb16.html &quot;Author, NIMH Epidemiologist Matthew Huxley Dies at 84&quot;.] 17 February 2005 ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Maria Huxley died of cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In 1956, Huxley married Laura Archera (1911–2007), also an author, as well as a violinist and psychotherapist.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; She wrote ''This Timeless Moment'', a biography of Huxley. She told the story of their marriage through Mary Ann Braubach's 2010 documentary, ''Huxley on Huxley''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://huxleyonhuxley.com/about/synopsis/ |title=Huxley on Huxley. |others=Dir. Mary Ann Braubach. Cinedigm, 2010.

Huxley was diagnosed with [[laryngeal cancer]] in 1960; in the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the Utopian novel ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bowering ''Aldous Huxley: A Study of the Major Novels'', p. 197, Oxford University Press, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and gave lectures on &quot;Human Potentialities&quot; both at the [[UCSF Medical Center]] and at the [[Esalen Institute]]. These lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the [[Human Potential Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kripal |first=Jeffrey |title=Esalen America and the Religion of No Religion |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2007}}[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/453699.html excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was a close friend of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] and [[Rosalind Rajagopal]] and was involved in the creation of the Happy Valley School, now [[Besant Hill School]] of Happy Valley, in [[Ojai, California]].

The most substantial collection of Huxley's few remaining papers, following the destruction of most in a fire, is at the [[University of California, Los Angeles Library|Library of the University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt1489q14s/ |title=Finding Aid for the Aldous and Laura Huxley papers, 1925–2007 |publisher=Special Collections, [[Charles E. Young Research Library]], UCLA |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are also at the [[Stanford University Libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findingaids.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=ead/mss/m0107.xml |title=Guide to the Aldous Huxley Collection, 1922–1934 |publisher=Dept. of Special Collections and University Archives |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 April 1962, Huxley was informed he was elected Companion of Literature by the [[Royal Society of Literature]], the senior literary organisation in Britain, and he accepted the title via letter on 28 April 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;Society&quot;&gt;Peter Edgerly Firchow, Hermann Josef Real (2005). ''The Perennial Satirist: Essays in Honour of Bernfried Nugel, Presented on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday'', p. 1. LIT Verlag Münster&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence between Huxley and the society is kept at the [[Cambridge University Library]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Society&quot; /&gt; The society invited Huxley to appear at a banquet and give a lecture at [[Somerset House]], London, in June 1963. Huxley wrote a draft of the speech he intended to give at the society; however, his deteriorating health meant he was not able to attend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Society&quot; /&gt;

== Death ==
On his deathbed, unable to speak owing to advanced laryngeal cancer, Huxley made a written request to his wife Laura for &quot;[[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], 100 [[Microgram|µg]], [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]].&quot; According to her account of his death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/03/most-beautiful-death.html |title=Account of Huxley's death on Letters of Note |publisher=Lettersofnote.com |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''This Timeless Moment'', she obliged with an injection at 11:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. and a second dose an hour later; Huxley died aged 69, at 5:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Los Angeles time), on 22 November 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Raychel Haugrud Reiff (2009). &quot;Aldous Huxley: Brave New World&quot;. p. 35. Marshall Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage of Huxley's death, along with that of fellow British author [[C. S. Lewis]], was overshadowed by the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of American President John F. Kennedy]] on the same day, less than seven hours before Huxley's death.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Ruddick (1993). &quot;Ultimate Island: On the Nature of British Science Fiction&quot;. p. 28. Greenwood Press&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine titled &quot;The Eclipsed Celebrity Death Club&quot;, Christopher Bonanos wrote:

{{quote|The championship trophy for badly timed death, though, goes to a pair of British writers. Aldous Huxley, the author of ''Brave New World'', died the same day as C. S. Lewis, who wrote the ''Chronicles of Narnia'' series. Unfortunately for both of their legacies, that day was November 22, 1963, just as John Kennedy's motorcade passed the [[Texas School Book Depository]]. Huxley, at least, made it interesting: At his request, his wife shot him up with LSD a couple of hours before the end, and he tripped his way out of this world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2009/06/the_eclipsed_celebrity_death_c.html?gtm=bottom&amp;gtm=bottom “The Eclipsed Celebrity Death Club”]. ''New York'' magazine. Retrieved 31 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This coincidence served as the basis for [[Peter Kreeft]]'s book ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (novel)|Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F. Kennedy, C. S. Lewis, &amp; Aldous Huxley]]'', which imagines a conversation among the three men taking place in Purgatory following their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kreeft |first1=Peter |title=Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F.

S. Lewis, John F. Kennedy, and Aldous Huxley. All three believed, in different ways, that death is not the end of human life. Suppose they were right, and suppose they met after death. How might the conversation go?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's memorial service took place in London in December 1963; it was led by his elder brother Julian. On 27 October 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aldous Huxley: A Biography |last=Murray |first=Nicholas |publisher=St. Martin's Press |date=2003 |isbn=978-0312302375 |page=[https://archive.org/details/aldoushuxleybiog00murr/page/455 455] |url=https://archive.org/details/aldoushuxleybiog00murr |url-access=registration |quote=27 october 1971. |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; his ashes were interred in the family grave at the Watts Cemetery, home of the [[Watts Mortuary Chapel]] in [[Compton, Guildford]], Surrey, England.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

Huxley had been a long-time friend of Russian composer [[Igor Stravinsky]], who later dedicated his last orchestral composition to Huxley. Stravinsky began ''Variations'' in Santa Fé, New Mexico, in July 1963, and completed the composition in Hollywood on 28 October 1964. It was first performed in Chicago on 17 April 1965, by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, conducted by [[Robert Craft]].&lt;ref&gt;Spies 1965, 62; White 1979, 534&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White 1979, 536–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Relevance to Huxley? : Although not composed for the purpose, Stravinsky's music was twice choreographed for the New York City Ballet by George Balanchine, a first version in 1966, and a second version in 1982, both times under the title ''Variations'' (Barnes 1966; Anderson 1982). --&gt;

Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD; see [[#Classification|Classification]]) from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the [[social communication]] of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with typical [[neural development]], as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Sacks O |author-link=Oliver Sacks |title=An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales |year=1995 |publisher=[[Alfred A.

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.&lt;!-- ref name=Volkmar/ --&gt; Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic [[toddler]]s differ more strikingly from [[social norms]]; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and [[turn-taking]], and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt; Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate [[nonverbal autism|nonverbal]]ly, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A | title = Early detection of core deficits in autism | journal = Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 221–233 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15666338 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20046 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.492.9930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most children with autism display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van Ijzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA | title = Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 1123–1134 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15257669 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older children and adults with ASD [[Face perception#In individuals with autism spectrum disorder|perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sigman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT | title = Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 2 | pages = 327–355 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17716073 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird G, Cook R | title = Mixed emotions: the contribution of alexithymia to the emotional symptoms of autism | journal = Translational Psychiatry | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = e285 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23880881 | pmc = 3731793 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2013.61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with high-functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

{{anchor|Aggression and violence}}
There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and meltdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Matson JL, Nebel-Schwalm M |title= Assessing challenging behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders: A review |journal= Research in Developmental Disabilities |volume= 28 |issue=6 |pages= 567–579 |date= November 2007 |pmid= 16973329 |doi= 10.1016/j.ridd.2006.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams DL, Goldstein G, Minshew NJ | title = Neuropsychologic functioning in children with autism: further evidence for disordered complex information-processing | journal = Child Neuropsychol | volume = 12 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 279–298 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16911973 | pmc = 1803025 | doi = 10.1080/09297040600681190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===
[[File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|alt=Sleeping boy beside a dozen or so toys arranged in a line|A young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row]]
Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman/&gt;

* [[Stereotypy|Stereotyped behaviors]]: Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
* [[Compulsive behavior]]s: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or hand washing.
* Sameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
* [[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]: Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lam-Aman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lam KS, Aman MG | s2cid = 41034513 | title = The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 855–866 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17048092 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z | url = https://www.academia.edu/14013119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Restricted interests: Interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game.
* [[Self-injury]]: Behaviors such as eye-poking, [[Dermatillomania|skin-picking]], hand-biting and head-banging.&lt;ref name=John2007/&gt;

No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH | s2cid = 16706630 | title = Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 237–243 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11055459 | doi = 10.1023/A:1005596502855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.&lt;ref name=Land2008/&gt; In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dover&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dover CJ, Le Couteur A | title = How to diagnose autism | journal = Arch Dis Child | volume = 92 | issue = 6 | pages = 540–545 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17515625 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2005.086280 | pmc=2066173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shattuck PT, Grosse SD | title = Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–135 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17563895 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [[visually impaired]], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or [[blindism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Visual impairment and autism: current questions and future research | last = Cass |first = Hilary | author-link = Hilary Cass | s2cid = 146237979 |journal=Autism |year=1998 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=117–138|doi=10.1177/1362361398022002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt;

Of the five PDD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [[PDD not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS; also called ''atypical autism'') is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkmar FR, State M, Klin A | title = Autism and autism spectrum disorders: diagnostic issues for the coming decade | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 108–115 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19220594 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02010.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in [[language development]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-IV-TR-299.00&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |edition=4th |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-89042-025-6 |oclc=768475353 |lccn=00024852 |chapter-url=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029080544/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 |via=Centers for Disease Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the ''autism spectrum disorders'' (ASD)&lt;ref name=CCD2007/&gt; or sometimes the ''autistic disorders'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Freitag CM | title = The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–22 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17033636 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'', ''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''.

Autism has long been thought to cover a wide [[Spectrum disorder|spectrum]], ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, [[developmentally disabled]], and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, [[pedantic]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Happé F | title = Understanding assets and deficits in autism: why success is more interesting than failure | journal = Psychologist | volume = 12 | issue = 11 | pages = 540–547 | year = 1999 | url = http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120517162434/http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Geschwind-2009/&gt; Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or [[high-functioning autism]] (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on [[IQ]] thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S | s2cid = 13271448 | title = The hyper-systemizing, assortative mating theory of autism | journal = Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 865–872 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16519981 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.010 | url = http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Neuropsychophamacology.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120513020615/http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Neuropsychophamacology.pdf | archivedate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people have called for an end to the terms &quot;high-functioning&quot; and &quot;low-functioning&quot; due to lack of nuance and the potential for a person's needs or abilities to be overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Researchers call for the term 'high functioning autism' to be consigned to history | first = Tony | last = Malkovic | name-list-format = vanc | website = Medical Xpress | url = https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-06-term-high-functioning-autism-consigned.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = How the &quot;High-Functioning&quot; Label is Letting Us Down | website = Milestones Autism Resources | url = https://www.milestones.org/resources/blog/2019/09/17/how-the-high-functioning-label-is-letting-us-down}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls.

Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Chaste/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardener H, Spiegelman D, Buka SL | title = Prenatal risk factors for autism: comprehensive meta-analysis | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 195 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–14 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19567888 | pmc = 3712619 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.051672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geschwind&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geschwind DH | title = Autism: many genes, common pathways? | journal = Cell | volume = 135 | issue = 3 | pages = 391–395 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18984147 | pmc = 2756410 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.10.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bertoglio K, Hendren RL | title = New developments in autism | journal = Psychiatr Clin North Am | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19248913 | doi = 10.1016/j.psc.2008.10.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other conditions are common in children with autism.&lt;ref name=Lev2009/&gt; They include:
* '''[[Genetic disorder]]s'''.

* '''[[Intellectual disability]]'''. The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of [[Intelligence assessment|assessing]] [[Controversies in autism#Intelligence|intelligence]] of individuals on the autism spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Learning in autism |vauthors=Dawson M, Mottron L, Gernsbacher MA |title=Learning and Memory: A Comprehensive Reference |volume=2 |pages=759–772 |veditors=Byrne JH, Roediger HL |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/B978-012370509-9.00152-2 |isbn=978-0-12-370504-4 |oclc=775005136 |chapterurl=http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |access-date=26 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303191513/http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, for PDD-NOS the association with intellectual disability is much weaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chakrabarti S, Fombonne E | title = Pervasive developmental disorders in preschool children | journal = JAMA | volume = 285 | issue = 24 | pages = 3093–3099 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11427137 | doi = 10.1001/jama.285.24.3093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by definition, the diagnosis of Asperger's excludes intellectual disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book | title=DSM-IV-TR Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition text revision | publisher=American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC | year=2000 | page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Anxiety disorder]]s''' are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White SW, Oswald D, Ollendick T, Scahill L | title = Anxiety in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–229 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19223098 | pmc = 2692135 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Epilepsy]]''', with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of [[language disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spence SJ, Schneider MT | title = The role of epilepsy and epileptiform EEGs in autism spectrum disorders | journal = Pediatr Res | volume = 65 | issue = 6 | pages = 599–606 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19454962 | pmc = 2692092 | doi = 10.1203/PDR.0b013e31819e7168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several '''[[metabolic defect]]s''', such as [[phenylketonuria]], are associated with autistic symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manzi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manzi B, Loizzo AL, Giana G, Curatolo P | s2cid = 30809774 | title = Autism and metabolic diseases | journal = J Child Neurol | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 307–314 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18079313 | doi = 10.1177/0883073807308698}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Minor physical anomalies]]''' are significantly increased in the autistic population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ozgen HM, Hop JW, Hox JJ, Beemer FA, van Engeland H | title = Minor physical anomalies in autism: a meta-analysis | journal = Mol Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 300–307 | year = 2010 | pmid = 18626481 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2008.75 | doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Preempted diagnoses'''. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[Tourette syndrome]], and other of these conditions are often present and these [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders|comorbid diagnoses]] are increasingly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steyaert JG, De la Marche W | s2cid = 11831418 | title = What's new in autism? | journal = Eur J Pediatr | volume = 167 | issue = 10 | pages = 1091–1101 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18597114 | doi = 10.1007/s00431-008-0764-4 | url = https://www.academia.edu/24262348}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sleep problems''' affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of [[insomnia]] such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richdale AL, Schreck KA | title = Sleep problems in autism spectrum disorders: prevalence, nature, &amp; possible biopsychosocial aetiologies | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 403–411 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19398354 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named.

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. He derived it from the Greek word ''autós'' (αὐτός, meaning &quot;self&quot;), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to &quot;autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhn R | s2cid = 5317716 | title = Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology | journal = Hist Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–366 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15386868 | doi = 10.1177/0957154X04044603}} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.&lt;/ref&gt; A Soviet child psychiatrist, [[Grunya Sukhareva]], described a similar syndrome that was published in Russian in 1925, and in German in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Manouilenko I, Bejerot S|s2cid=207473133|title=Sukhareva—Prior to Asperger and Kanner|journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry|type=Report|publication-date=31 March 2015|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1761–1764|doi=10.3109/08039488.2015.1005022|issn=1502-4725|pmid=25826582|year=2015|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:oru:diva-47358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–1317 | title = Das psychisch abnormale Kind |trans-title=The psychically abnormal child | vauthors = Asperger H | author-link1 = Hans Asperger | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;/&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanner1943&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | author-link1 = Leo Kanner |title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal=Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–250 |year=1943| issue = 4 | pmid = 4880460 }} Reprinted in {{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | title = Autistic disturbances of affective contact | journal = Acta Paedopsychiatr | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 100–136 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4880460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;HappeTime&quot;/&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons V, Fitzgerald M | s2cid = 38130758 | title = Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 2022–2023 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17922179 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Triplett]] was the first person diagnosed with autism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; He was diagnosed by Kanner after being first examined in 1938, and was labeled as &quot;case 1&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pallardy|first1=Richard| name-list-format = vanc |title=Donald Triplett|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Donald-Triplett|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=19 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers. His father, Oliver, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and U.S. president pictures. By the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the Presbyterian [[catechism]]. He was also interested in creating musical chords.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlantic&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donvan|first1=John|last2=Zucker|first2=Caren | name-list-format = vanc |title=Autism's First Child|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/10/autisms-first-child/308227/|access-date=19 March 2017|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to &quot;[[refrigerator mother]]s&quot;. Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fombonne E | s2cid = 8868418 | title = Modern views of autism | journal = Can J Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 8 | pages = 503–505 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14574825 | url = http://ww1.cpa-apc.org/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp| doi = 10.1177/070674370304800801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terminology and distinction from schizophrenia ===
As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders | vauthors = Szatmari P, Jones MB | author-link1 = Peter Szatmari | pages=157–178 |title=Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition=2nd |editor=Volkmar FR |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-54957-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;/&gt; parents continue to feel [[social stigma]] in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chambres P, Auxiette C, Vansingle C, Gil S | s2cid = 19769173 | title = Adult attitudes toward behaviors of a six-year-old boy with autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1320–1327 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18297387 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0519-5 | url = https://www.academia.edu/20027016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[primary care physician]]s and [[medical specialist]]s express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidgerken AD, Geffken G, Modi A, Frakey L | s2cid = 2015723 | title = A survey of autism knowledge in a health care setting | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–330 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16119473 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-3298-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took until 1980 for the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III]] to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the [[DSM-III-R]] provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the [[DSM-5]] was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including [[PDD-NOS]], autism, [[Asperger syndrome]], [[Rett syndrome]], and [[Childhood disintegrative disorder|CDD]], has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker JP | title = Autism at 70--redrawing the boundaries | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 12 | pages = 1089–1091 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24047057 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1306380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biever C | title = Web removes social barriers for those with autism |journal=New Scientist |issue=2610 |pages=26–27 |year=2007 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426106.100 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020165135/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426106.100 |archivedate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Societal and cultural aspects of autism]] have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that [[Neurodiversity|autism is simply another way of being]].&lt;ref name=Sil2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frith2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Harmon A |title=How about not 'curing' us, some autistics are pleading |date=20 December 2004 |work=The New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002649/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html |archivedate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autism rights movement ===
The [[autism rights movement]] is a [[social movement]] within the context of [[disability rights movement|disability right]]s that emphasizes the concept of [[neurodiversity]], viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the [[human brain]] rather than a disorder to be cured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot;/&gt; The autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism,&lt;ref name=Bigthink&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ratner |first1=Paul | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Should Autism Be Cured or Is &quot;Curing&quot; Offensive? |url=https://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/should-autism-be-cured-or-is-curing-offfensive |website=Big Think |access-date=16 June 2019 |date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the recognition of the autistic community as a [[minority group]].&lt;ref name=Bigthink/&gt;&lt;ref name= Jaarsma2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaarsma P, Welin S | s2cid = 18618887 | title = Autism as a natural human variation: reflections on the claims of the neurodiversity movement | journal = Health Care Analysis | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–30 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 21311979 | doi = 10.1007/s10728-011-0169-9 | url = http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-72172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the [[human genome]]. This perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: the medical perspective, that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene(s), and [[fringe theories]] that autism is caused by environmental factors such as [[vaccine]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot;/&gt; A common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are &quot;[[High-functioning autism|high-functioning]]&quot; or have [[Asperger syndrome]] and do not represent the views of &quot;[[Low-functioning autism|low-functioning]]&quot; autistic people.&lt;ref name= Jaarsma2012/&gt; 

===Employment===
About half of autistics are unemployed, and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohl&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohl A, Grice Sheff M, Small S, Nguyen J, Paskor K, Zanjirian A | title = Predictors of employment status among adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder | journal = Work | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 345–355 |year = 2017 | pmid = 28211841 | doi = 10.3233/WOR-172492 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among autistics who find work, most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=DePillis |first1=Lydia | name-list-format = vanc |title=Disabled people are allowed to work for pennies per hour – but maybe not for much longer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/12/disabled-people-are-allowed-to-work-for-pennies-per-hour-but-maybe-not-for-much-longer/?noredirect=on |access-date=31 December 2018 |work=The Washington Post|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision, experienced employers of autistics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohl&quot;/&gt; A majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ganz ML | title = The lifetime distribution of the incremental societal costs of autism | journal = Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med | volume = 161 | issue = 4 | pages = 343–349 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17404130 | doi = 10.1001/archpedi.161.4.343 | lay-url = http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2006-releases/press04252006.html | laydate = 25 April 2006 | laysource = Harvard School of Public Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montes G, Halterman JS | s2cid = 55179 | title = Association of childhood autism spectrum disorders and loss of family income | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pages = e821–26 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18381511 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2007-1594 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/121/4/e821 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100304071520/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/121/4/e821 | archivedate = 4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montes G, Halterman JS | s2cid = 22686553 | title = Child care problems and employment among families with preschool-aged children with autism in the United States | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = e202–08 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18595965 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2007-3037 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/122/1/e202 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091206190622/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/122/1/e202 | archivedate = 6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The percentage of [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] [[sunlight]] relative to various surface conditions]]

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}) ({{lang-la|albedo}}, meaning 'whiteness') is the measure of the [[diffuse reflection]] of [[sunlight|solar radiation]] out of the total [[solar radiation]] and measured on a scale from 0, corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation, to 1, corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation.

Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of [[Radiosity (radiometry)|radiosity]] to the [[irradiance]] (flux per unit area) received by a surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent.1/classes/782/Lectures/03_Radiometry.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter9/Ency_Atmos/Reflectance_Albedo_Surface.pdf |title=Reflectance and albedo, surface |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Atmosphere |editor=J. R. Holton |editor2=J. A. Curry |last=Coakley |first=J. A. |publisher=Academic Press |year=2003|pages=1914–1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see [[position of the Sun]]). While bi-hemispherical [[reflectance]] is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.

Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henderson-Sellers |first=A. |last2=Wilson |first2=M. F.|year=1983 |quote=Albedo observations of the Earth's surface for climate research |jstor=37357 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A |volume=309 |issue=1508 |title=The Study of the Ocean and the Land Surface from Satellites |pages=285–294 |bibcode=1983RSPTA.309..285H |doi=10.1098/rsta.1983.0042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes [[visible spectrum|visible light]] (0.4–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).

Albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and environmental management (e.g., as part of the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings). The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30–35% because of [[cloud cover]], but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Encyclopedia |url=https://archive.org/details/environmentalenc01cunn |url-access=registration |edition=3rd |publisher=Thompson Gale |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7876-5486-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term albedo was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''[[Photometria]]''.

Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo – from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot;/&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

[[File:Ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|upright=1.2|left|2003–2004 mean annual clear-sky and total-sky albedo]]
Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites, and the CERES instrument on the [[Suomi NPP]] and [[Joint Polar Satellite System|JPSS]]. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot;/&gt;). These calculations are based on the [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.

Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15&amp;nbsp;°C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot; /&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot;/&gt; In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water – a so-called [[ocean planet]] – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot;/&gt;

===White-sky, black-sky, and blue-sky albedo===
For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms:
* the [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo, and
* the [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]], &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as white-sky albedo.
with &lt;math&gt;{1-D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{ \bar \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot;/&gt;

== Astronomical albedo ==

The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[minor planet]]s such as [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.99. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96.&lt;ref name=&quot;sicardy&quot;&gt;

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [[regolith]] surfaces.

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometers, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute magnitude.

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==

===Illumination===
Albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth's surface at that location (e.g. through melting of reflective ice). That said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99 |pages=818–827| bibcode=1971MWRv...99..818W| date=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099&lt;0818:TACOZM&gt;2.3.CO;2| issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insolation effects===
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]] (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the [[arctic]] and [[antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the [[Sahara Desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  [[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rainforest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the [[Earth]]. This has been a concern since arctic ice and [[snow]] has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This [[Ice-albedo feedback|feedback loop]] results in a reduced albedo effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721364-commercial-opportunities-are-vastly-outweighed-damage-climate-thawing-arctic|title=The thawing Arctic threatens an environmental catastrophe|journal=The Economist|access-date=8 May 2017|date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate and weather===
Albedo affects [[climate]] by determining how much [[radiation]] a planet absorbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=av7q4N8Ib6sC&amp;pg=PA53|title=Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather: Abs-Ero|last=Schneider|first=Stephen Henry|last2=Mastrandrea|first2=Michael D.|last3=Root|first3=Terry L.|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976532-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive [[weather]].

===Albedo–temperature feedback===
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

===Snow===
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, D.K. and Martinec, J. (1985), ''Remote sensing of ice and snow''. Chapman and Hall, New York, 189 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Over [[Antarctica]] snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo [[positive feedback]]).

Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;All About Sea Ice.&quot; National Snow and Ice Data Center. Accessed 16 November 2017. /cryosphere/seaice/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for [[global warming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nat. Geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;Changing Greenland – Melt Zone&quot;] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool! (August 1997) |publisher=Ranknfile-ue.org |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar photovoltaic effects ===
Albedo can affect the [[electrical energy]] output of solar [[photovoltaic system|photovoltaic devices]]. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions.

===Trees===
Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and [[visible spectrum]] is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of [[deforestation]]). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Betts | first1 = RA | date = 2000 | title = Offset of the potential carbon sink from boreal forestation by decreases in surface albedo | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = 6809| pages = 187–190 | doi = 10.1038/35041545 | pmid=11089969|bibcode = 2000Natur.408..187B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [[evapotranspiration]]. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boucher | date = 2004 | title = Direct human influence of irrigation on atmospheric water vapour and climate | journal = Climate Dynamics | volume = 22 | issue = 6–7| pages = 597–603 | doi=10.1007/s00382-004-0402-4|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2004ClDy...22..597B | url = https://www.academia.edu/25329256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonan | first1 = GB | date = 2008 | title = Forests and Climate Change: Forcings, Feedbacks, and the Climate Benefits of Forests | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5882| pages = 1444–1449 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155121 | pmid=18556546|bibcode = 2008Sci...320.1444B  | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230896 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt; Variation in summer albedo across both forest types is correlated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ollinger&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt;

===Water===
[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (refractive index=1.333)]]
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).

At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresnel&quot; /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.
Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=24 January 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contrails reduce daily temperature range|url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|journal=Nature |accessdate=7 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|archivedate=3 May 2006|page=601|volume=418|issue=6898|date=8 August 2002|url-status=dead|doi=10.1038/418601a|bibcode = 2002Natur.418..601T|pmid=12167846|last1=Travis|first1=D.

G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&amp;nbsp;°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvard&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Kuwait oil fires as seen by Landsat |date=30 May 1991|bibcode=1992JGR....9714565C |last1=Cahalan |first1=Robert F. |volume=97 |issue=D13 |page=14565 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres |doi=10.1029/92JD00799|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23842551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=19 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Spracklen et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOMINICK&quot; /&gt; the effects are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean [[radiative forcing]] for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=19 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l. Acad. of Sci. 423 (13 January 2004) (&quot;The efficacy of this forcing is »2 (i.e., for a given forcing it is twice as effective as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in altering global surface air temperature)&quot;); ''compare'' Zender Testimony, ''supra'' note 7, at 4 (figure 3); See J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 18, at 426. (&quot;The efficacy for changes of Arctic sea ice albedo is &gt;3. In additional runs not shown here, we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in Antarctica is also &gt;3.&quot;); ''See also'' Flanner, M.G., C.S. Zender, J.T. Randerson, and P.J. Rasch, ''Present-day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow'', 112 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D11202 (2007) (&quot;The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset, triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the &quot;efficacy&quot; of black carbon/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2020}}

===Human activities===
Human activities (e.g., deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult, further study is required to determine anthropogenic effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sagan|first=Carl|last2=Toon|first2=Owen B.|last3=Pollack|first3=James B.|date=1979|title=Anthropogenic Albedo Changes and the Earth's Climate|journal=Science|volume=206|issue=4425|pages=1363–1368|issn=0036-8075|jstor=1748990|doi=10.1126/science.206.4425.1363|pmid=17739279|bibcode=1979Sci...206.1363S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types of albedo==
[[Single-scattering albedo]] is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

'''A''' or '''a''' is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] and the first [[vowel letter]] of the [[English alphabet|modern English alphabet]] and the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; Its name in English is [[English alphabet#Letter names|''a'']] (pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|eɪ}}), plural [[English alphabet#Letter names|''aes'']].{{refn|group=nb|''Aes'' is the plural of the name of the letter. The plural of the letter itself is rendered ''A''s, A's, ''a''s, or a's.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|Weiner|1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is similar in shape to the [[Greek_alphabet#History|Ancient Greek letter]] [[alpha]], from which it derives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarter|1974|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''ɑ'''. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in [[italic type]].

In the English grammar, &quot;a&quot;, and its variant &quot;an&quot;, are [[Article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite articles]].

The earliest certain ancestor of &quot;A&quot; is [[aleph]] (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the [[Phoenician alphabet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted entirely of [[consonant]]s (for that reason, it is also called an [[abjad]] to distinguish it from a true [[alphabet]]). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an ox head in [[proto-Sinaitic script]]&lt;ref name=Coll&gt;{{harvnb|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.

By 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo-Hebrew]] or [[Arabic script|Arabic]] [[aleph]].

When the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the [[glottal stop]]—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]], and that was the first [[phoneme]] of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and called it by the similar name of [[alpha]]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic script|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin|Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.

===Typographic variants===
[[File:A-small glyphs.svg|thumb|140px|Different [[glyphs]] of the lowercase letter A.]]
During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter &quot;A&quot;. First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other &quot;permanent&quot; media. There was also a [[cursive]] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the &quot;perishable&quot; nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.&lt;ref name=Americana&gt;{{harvnb|Diringer|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LowercaseA.svg|left|thumb|200px|[[Allography|Typographic variants]] include a double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''ɑ'''.]]At the end of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[Italy]], the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the [[Carolingian minuscule|Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt;

15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called ''script a,'' is used in most current [[handwriting]] and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it (&quot;a&quot;).&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

[[Italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where ''script a'' (&quot;ɑ&quot;), also called [[Latin alpha]], is used in contrast with Latin &quot;a&quot; (such as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]).

==Use in writing systems==
[[File:Pronunciation of the name of the letter ⟨a⟩ in European languages.png|thumb|Pronunciation of the name of the letter {{angbr|a}} in European languages, note that /a/ and /aː/ can differ phonetically between {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPAblink|ä}}, {{IPAblink|æ}} and {{IPAblink|ɑ}} depending on the language.|305x305px]]
===English===
{{further information|Pronunciation of English ⟨a⟩}}
In modern [[English orthography]], the letter {{angbr|a}} represents at least seven different vowel sounds:
*the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/æ/}} as in ''pad'';
*the [[open back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɑː/}} as in ''father'', which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound;&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt;
*the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/eɪ/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'' (usually when {{vr|a}} is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letter) – this results from [[Middle English lengthening]] followed by the [[Great Vowel Shift]];
*the modified form of the above sound that occurs [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|before {{vr|r}}]], as in ''square'' and ''Mary'';
*the rounded vowel of ''water'';
*the shorter rounded vowel (not present in [[General American]]) in ''was'' and ''what'';&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;
*a [[schwa]], in many unstressed syllables, as in ''about'', ''comma'', ''solar''.

The double {{angbr|aa}} sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as ''Aaron'' and ''[[aardvark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelb|Whiting|1998|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{vr|a}} occurs in [[List of Latin-script digraphs|many common digraphs]], all with their own sound or sounds, particularly {{vr|ai}}, {{vr|au}}, {{vr|aw}}, {{vr|ay}}, {{vr|ea}} and {{vr|oa}}.

{{angbr|a}} is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|t}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second most common in Spanish and French. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English texts tend to be {{angbr|a}}, while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other languages===
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, {{angbr|a}} denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as {{IPA|/[[Open front unrounded vowel|a]]/}}, {{IPA|/[[Open central unrounded vowel|ä]]/}}, or {{IPA|/[[Open back unrounded vowel|ɑ]]/}}. An exception is [[Saanich dialect|Saanich]], in which {{angbr|a}} (and the glyph [[Á]]) stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}.

===Other systems===

In phonetic and phonemic notation:
*in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angbr IPA|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{angbr IPA|ä}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]], and {{angbr IPA|ɑ}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].
*in [[X-SAMPA]], {{angbr|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and {{angbr|A}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

==Other uses==
{{main article|A (disambiguation)}}
In [[algebra]], the letter ''a'' along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') are used to denote unknown quantities.

In [[geometry]], capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote [[Line segment|segment]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[Line (geometry)#Ray|rays]], etc.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]], the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt;

&quot;A&quot; is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; &quot;A grade&quot; for clean restaurants; [[A-list]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ciani &amp; Sheldon|2010|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;A&quot; is used as a prefix on some words, such as [[asymmetry]], to mean &quot;not&quot; or &quot;without&quot; (from Greek).

In English grammar, &quot;a&quot;, and its variant &quot;an&quot;, is an [[Article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite article]].

Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe,&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt; or a small cup size in a [[brassiere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The bra book : the fashion formula to finding the perfect bra|last=Luciani|first=Jené|date=2009|publisher=Benbella Books, Inc|others=Voltz, Ralph.|isbn=9781933771946|location=Dallas, TX|pages=13|oclc=317453115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alabama''' ({{IPAc-en|,|æ|l|ə|'|b|æ|m|ə|}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Southern United States|southeastern region]] of the [[United States]]. It is bordered by [[Tennessee]] to the north, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the east, [[Florida]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south, and [[Mississippi]] to the west. Alabama is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|30th largest by area]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|24th-most populous]] of the [[List of U.S. states|U.S. states]]. With a total of {{convert|1500|mi|km}} of [[inland waterway]]s, Alabama has among the most of any state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alabama Transportation Overview |url=https://www.edpa.org/wp-content/uploads/Alabama-Transportation-Overview-1.pdf |publisher=Economic Development Partnership of Alabama |accessdate=January 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113075704/https://www.edpa.org/wp-content/uploads/Alabama-Transportation-Overview-1.pdf |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama is nicknamed the ''[[Northern flicker|Yellowhammer]] State'', after the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]]. Alabama is also known as the &quot;Heart of [[Dixie]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Cotton]] State&quot;. The [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] is the [[longleaf pine]], and the [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flower]] is the [[camellia]]. Alabama's capital is [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. The largest city by population is [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]],&lt;ref name=&quot;quickcensus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01000.html |title=Alabama |website=QuickFacts |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910132303/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01000.html |archivedate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has long been the most industrialized city; the largest city by land area is [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. The oldest city is [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], founded by French [[colonists]] in 1702 as the capital of [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pelican&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomason |first=Michael |title=Mobile: The New History of Alabama's First City|year=2001 |publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=978-0-8173-1065-3|pages=2–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birmingham metropolitan area, Alabama|Greater Birmingham]] is Alabama's largest urban economy, its most populous urban area, and its economic center.&lt;ref&gt;https://alabamanewscenter.com/2018/08/31/alabamas-largest-county-looks-to-continue-economic-development-momentum/&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[American Civil War]] until [[World War II]], Alabama, like many states in the [[southern U.S.]], suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence on [[agriculture]]. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against [[African Americans]] from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until at least the 1970s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests.

The European-American naming of the [[Alabama River]] and state was derived from the [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the [[confluence]] of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers on the upper reaches of the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=978-0-8173-0231-3 |oclc=10724679}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Alabama language]], the word for a person of Alabama lineage is ''Albaamo'' (or variously ''Albaama'' or ''Albàamo'' in different dialects; the plural form is ''Albaamaha'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authors=Sylestine, Cora; Hardy; Heather; and [[Timothy Montler|Montler, Timothy]] |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-292-73077-9 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024054330/http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |archivedate=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion that &quot;Alabama&quot; was borrowed from the [[Choctaw language]] is unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/248152?redirectedFrom=alabama&amp; &quot;Alabama, n. and adj.&quot;].

===Pre-European settlement===
[[File:Moundville Archaeological Site Alabama.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in Hale County. It was occupied by Native Americans of the [[Mississippian culture]] from 1000 to 1450 CE.]]

[[Indigenous peoples]] of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes by the [[Ohio River]] began during the Burial Mound Period (1000{{nbsp}}BCE{{snd}}700{{nbsp}}CE) and continued until [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorkTimesAlmanac&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |title=Alabama |date=August 11, 2006 |work=The New York Times Almanac 2004 |accessdate=September 23, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016195242/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |archivedate=October 16, 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agrarian [[Mississippian culture]] covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 CE, with one of its major centers built at what is now the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in [[Moundville, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Welch |first= Paul D. |title= Moundville's Economy |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1991 |isbn= 978-0-8173-0512-3 |oclc= 21330955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Walthall |first= John A. |title= Prehistoric Indians of the Southeast-Archaeology of Alabama and the Middle South |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1990 |isbn= 978-0-8173-0552-9 |oclc= 26656858}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after [[Cahokia]] in present-day [[Illinois]], which was the center of the culture.

With exploration in the 16th century, the Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama. The expedition of [[Hernando de Soto]] passed through [[Mabila]] and other parts of the state in 1540.

From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: [[Jeremiah Haralson]], [[Benjamin S. Turner]], and [[James T. Rapier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alabamamoments.alabama.gov/sec24.html |title=Reconstruction in Alabama: A Quick Summary |website=Alabama Moments in American History |publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913020916/http://www.alabamamoments.alabama.gov/sec24.html |archive-date=September 13, 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], state legislators ratified a [[Constitution of Alabama|new state constitution]] in 1868 which created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and [[misappropriation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; Organized [[insurgent]], resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. Besides the short-lived original [[Ku Klux Klan]], these included the Pale Faces, [[Knights of the White Camellia]], [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], and the [[White League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt;

Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. They wrote another constitution in 1875,&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; and the legislature passed the [[Blaine Amendment]], prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |title=A Blaine Amendment Update (July 00) |publisher=Schoolreport.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716014339/http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, legislation was approved that called for [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classroomhelp.com/till/jimcrowlaws/jimcrowalabama.html |title=Jim Crow Laws in Alabama |website=Emmett Till, It All Began with a Whistle |publisher=Classroomhelp |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt; After disenfranchising most African Americans and many poor whites in the 1901 constitution, the Alabama legislature passed more [[Jim Crow laws]] at the beginning of the 20th century to impose segregation in everyday life.

The new 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]] included provisions for [[voter registration]] that effectively [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor whites, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and [[literacy test]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Kousser. ''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. By 1903, only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were [[literate]]. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt; The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt;

While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt; By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African-Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;&gt;Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1248 |title=Segregation (Jim Crow) |last= |first=|date= |website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|language=en |access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |title= The Black Belt |accessdate =September 23, 2006 |date= April 19, 2004 |journal= Southern Spaces |publisher= Emory University|doi= 10.18737/M70K6P |last1= Tullos |first1= Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the [[Rosenwald Fund]] began funding the construction of what came to be known as [[Rosenwald School]]s. In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenwaldal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings MPS |website=National Register Information System |url={{NRHP url|id=64500011}} |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1913, the first 80 [[Rosenwald Schools]] were built in Alabama for African-American children.

Continued racial discrimination and [[lynching]]s, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to [[boll weevil]] infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hine |first1=Darlene |last2=Hine |first2=William |last3=Harrold |first3=Stanley |title=African Americans: A Concise History |date=2012 |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Boston |isbn=9780205806270 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/africanamericans0000hine_i0f5/page/388 388–389] |edition=4th |url=https://archive.org/details/africanamericans0000hine_i0f5/page/388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Migration |title=Great Migration {{!}} African-American history|work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=May 26, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see &quot;historical populations&quot; table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;census data&quot; /&gt;

{{quote|Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter-steps designed to disfranchise black voters. The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants. Black citizens in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]. The legislature also changed the boundaries of [[Tuskegee, Alabama|Tuskegee]] to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits. The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial &quot;[[gerrymandering]]&quot; violated the Constitution. In 1961,{{nbsp}}... the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;vra&quot;&gt;James Blacksher, Edward Still, Nick Quinton, Cullen Brown and Royal Dumas.

Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt; Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile.

Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. One result was that [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]], containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, &quot;a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |title=George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary.

In the United States Supreme Court cases of ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962) and ''[[Reynolds v.

In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot; /&gt; Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.

African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the [[civil rights movement]], including legal challenges. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply.

Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;vra&quot; /&gt;

As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;cum&quot;&gt;[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 &quot;Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004)&quot;/&quot;Proportional Voting in Alabama&quot;], FairVote Archives, accessed January 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Alabama}}

The state is classified as [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'') under the [[Humid temperate climate|Koppen Climate Classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1283 |title=Encyclopedia of Alabama: Climate |date=August 17, 2007 |publisher=University of Alabama |access-date=April 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621180731/http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1283 |archive-date=June 21, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature is 64&amp;nbsp;°F (18&amp;nbsp;°C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-78303/Alabama |title=Alabama Climate |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of {{convert|56|in|mm}} of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;/&gt;

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over {{convert|90|°F}} throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to [[tropical storm]]s and even [[hurricane]]s. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.

South Alabama reports many [[thunderstorm]]s. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent [[lightning]] and large [[hail]]; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/04-13state_fatality_rates.pdf Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 2004–2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010029/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/04-13state_fatality_rates.pdf |date=April 27, 2014}}.

Alabama, along with [[Oklahoma]] and [[Iowa]], has the most confirmed [[Fujita scale|F5]] and [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF5]] tornadoes of any state, according to statistics from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsnet5.com/weather/weather-news/kshb-list-states-with-the-most-ef5-tornadoes LIST: States with the most F5/EF5 tornadoes since 1950; Ohio high on list] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232719/http://www.newsnet5.com/weather/weather-news/kshb-list-states-with-the-most-ef5-tornadoes |date=April 26, 2014}}. Retrieved April 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state. The state was affected by the [[1974 Super Outbreak]] and was devastated tremendously by the [[2011 Super Outbreak]]. The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oliver |first=Mike |title=April 27's record tally: 62 tornadoes in Alabama |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/08/april_27s_record_tally_62_torn.html |website= |publisher=al.com |accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December besides the typically severe spring. The northern part—along the Tennessee River Valley—is most vulnerable. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the [[Southeastern United States]], with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|°F}} in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is {{convert|2|in|mm}} per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

Alabama's highest temperature of {{convert|112|°F}} was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of [[Centerville, Alabama|Centerville]]. The record low of {{convert|-27|°F}} occurred on January 30, 1966, in [[New Market, Alabama|New Market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/recordtemps.html |title=Record high and low temperatures for all 50 states |website=Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=accuracyproject.org |accessdate=November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states, demographers estimated there are more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than self-reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US01&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR2&amp;-ds_name=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false |title=American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=February 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200211182250/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US01&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR2&amp;-ds_name=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false |archive-date=February 11, 2020 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots-Irish but, based on historic immigration and settlement, their ancestors were more likely Protestant Scots-Irish coming from northern Ireland, where they had been for a few generations as part of the English colonization.&lt;ref name=&quot;census-ancestries&quot;&gt;[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/:Census-2000-Data-Top-US-Ancestries-by-County.jpg &quot;Census 2000 Map—Top U.S. Ancestries by County&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.&lt;ref&gt;David Hackett Fischer, Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.361–368&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the [[Alabama Indian Affairs Commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aiac&quot;&gt;[http://www.aiac.state.al.us/tribes.aspx &quot;Alabama Indian Affairs Commission&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003045646/http://www.aiac.state.al.us/tribes.aspx |date=October 3, 2013}}, State of Alabama, accessed September 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black.

The state has [[State recognized tribes in the United States|officially recognized]] nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the American Southeast. These are the following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aiac.alabama.gov/ByLaws.aspx |title=AIAC Bylaws |website=Alabama Indian Affairs Commission |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918101025/http://aiac.alabama.gov/ByLaws.aspx |archivedate=September 18, 2012 |df= mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Most Alabama residents (95.1% of those five and older) spoke only English at home in 2010, a minor decrease from 96.1% in 2000. Alabama English is predominantly [[Southern American English|Southern]],&lt;ref name=&quot;city-data.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city-data.com/states/Alabama-Languages.html |title=Alabama—Languages |website=city-data.com |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is related to South Midland speech which was taken across the border from [[Tennessee]]. In the major Southern speech region, there is the decreasing loss of the final /r/, for example the /boyd/ pronunciation of 'bird'. In the northern third of the state, there is a South Midland 'arm' and 'barb' rhyming with 'form' and 'orb'. Unique words in Alabama English include: redworm ([[earthworm]]), peckerwood ([[woodpecker]]), snake doctor and snake feeder ([[dragonfly]]), tow sack ([[Gunny sack|burlap bag]]), plum peach ([[Clingstone peach|clingstone]]), French harp ([[harmonica]]), and dog irons ([[Andiron|andirons]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;city-data.com&quot;/&gt;

Alabama is located in the middle of the [[Bible Belt]], a region of numerous Protestant Christians. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060502/news_lz1n2thelist.html |title=Church or synagogue attendance by state |website=The San Diego Union-Tribune |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513103435/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060502/news_lz1n2thelist.html |archivedate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. {{as of|2010}}, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], [[The United Methodist Church]], and [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational]] Evangelical Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp |publisher=The Association of Religion Data Archives |title=State membership Report |accessdate=November 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012074403/http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp |archive-date=October 12, 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alabama, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the [[United Methodist Church]] with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the [[Great Awakening]] of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The [[Assemblies of God]] had almost 60,000 members, the [[Churches of Christ]] had nearly 120,000 members. The [[Presbyterian church]]es, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 ([[Presbyterian Church in America|PCA]]—28,009 members in 108 congregations, [[PC(USA)]]—26,247 members in 147 congregations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp |publisher=The Association of Religion Data Archives |title=Maps &amp; Reports |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012074403/http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp |archive-date=October 12, 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]]—6,000 members in 59 congregations, the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America]]—5,000 members and fifty congregations plus the [[Edgewater Presbyterian Church|EPC]] and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and nine congregations).&lt;ref name=&quot;thearda&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/01_2000.asp |title=State Membership Reports |year=2000 |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |publisher=thearda.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829192301/http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/01_2000.asp |archive-date=August 29, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and [[fabrication (metal)|fabrication]]. By 2006, crop and animal production in Alabama was valued at $1.5 billion. In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about 1% of the state's gross domestic product. The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2330 |title=Food Production in Alabama |last1=Ijaz |first1=Ahmad |last2=Addy |first2=Samuel N. |date=July 6, 2009 |website=The Encyclopedia of Alabama |publisher=Auburn University |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2330 |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A great deal of Alabama's economic growth since the 1990s has been due to the state's expanding automotive manufacturing industry. Located in the state are [[Honda Manufacturing of Alabama]], [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama]], [[Mercedes-Benz U.S. International]], and [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama]], as well as their various suppliers. Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation for vehicle exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2008_fotw539.html |title=Vehicle Technologies Program: Fact #539: October 6, 2008, Light Vehicle Production by State |publisher=.eere.energy.gov |date=October 6, 2008 |accessdate=October 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006202740/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2008_fotw539.html |archivedate=October 6, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State government===
{{Main|Government of Alabama}}
[[File:Alabama Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama State Capitol|State Capitol Building]] in Montgomery, completed in 1851]]

The foundational document for Alabama's government is the [[Alabama Constitution]], which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is by some accounts the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Lockette, [http://www.annistonstar.com/article_c928bd51-fbf1-5056-a30c-1bf4b19eb012.html?mode=jqm Is the Alabama Constitution the longest constitution in the world?Truth Rating: 4 out of 5], ''Anniston Star''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Robertson, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/us/alabama-simmers-before-vote-on-its-constitutions-racist-language.html Alabama Simmers Before Vote on Its Constitution's Racist Language], ''New York Times'', October 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A16443-2004Nov27 |last=Roig-Franzia |first=Manuel |title=Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds |work=The Washington Post |date=November 28, 2004 |accessdate=September 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |title=Constitution of Alabama—1901 |website=The Alabama Legislative Information System |accessdate=September 22, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923081542/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |archivedate=September 23, 2006 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |title=Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform |publisher=Constitutionalreform.org |accessdate=October 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915165938/http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |archivedate=September 15, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that Alabama's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.
[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]

Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of &quot;[[one man, one vote]]&quot;, ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.

At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.
[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]] is the current [[governor of Alabama]].]]

The [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[governor of Alabama]]. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor of Alabama]], the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[State Auditor of Alabama]]. The current governor is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]].

The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |title=Alabama's Legislative Process |first=McDowell |last=Lee |year=2009 |publisher=State of Alabama |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102162559/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |archivedate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Judiciary|judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting the state's [[Alabama Constitution|Constitution]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The [[State supreme court|state's highest court]] is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJS&quot;&gt;[http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=AL Judicial Selection in the States: Alabama] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006162358/http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=AL |date=October 6, 2014}}, American Judicature Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[chief justice]] of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican [[Tom Parker (judge)|Tom Parker]]. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party. There are two intermediate [[appellate court]]s, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four [[trial court]]s: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJS&quot;/&gt;

===Taxes===
Taxes are collected by the [[Alabama Department of Revenue]].&lt;ref&gt;https://revenue.alabama.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; Alabama levies a 2, 4, or{{nbsp}}5 percent [[State income tax|personal income tax]], depending on the amount earned and filing status.

Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003, Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670 million.

===County and local governments===
{{See also|List of counties in Alabama}}
{{Alabama County Labelled Map|align=right|width=300}}

Alabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.

The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;/&gt; Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;. Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.

&quot;The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P. Brewer, &quot;Home Rule&quot;], ''Encyclopedia of Alabama'', 2007, accessed February 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]], meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. The [[Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board]] controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. Twenty-five of the 67 counties are &quot;[[Dry county|dry counties]]&quot; which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcboard.alabama.gov/%28S%28s1j4zjl5nddpfshvrhppmpsb%29%29/wet_dry_map.aspx Wet-Dry Map] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009231316/http://abcboard.alabama.gov/(S(s1j4zjl5nddpfshvrhppmpsb))/wet_dry_map.aspx |date=October 9, 2016}}, Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
During [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.

After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;/&gt; and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.

In 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2017|December|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
{{Main|Elections in Alabama}}
[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] won a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election]] in 2017.]]

====State elections====
With the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of Blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]]&quot;, a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.

Members of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.

In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[Freedman|freedmen]] who had gained the franchise. The three GOP lieutenant governors are [[Steve Windom]] (1999–2003), [[Kay Ivey]] (2011–2017), and [[Will Ainsworth]] (2019–present).

====Local elections====
Many local offices (county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, tax collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=1 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Democratic Primary Election Results—Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=2 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Republican Primary Election Results—Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date=February 15, 2007 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, [[at-large]] races, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts. The current split is 35 [[Alabama Democratic Party|Democrats]], 31 [[Alabama Republican Party|Republicans]], and one Independent Fayette.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/pages?id=41 |title=Alabama Sheriffs 2015–2019 |website=www.alabamasheriffs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties. {{as of|2015}}, the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in [[Morgan County, Alabama]], and ten African-American sheriffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASA&quot;/&gt;

====Federal elections====
The state's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are Republican [[Richard Shelby|Richard C. Shelby]] and Democrat [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]]. Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election.

In the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: ([[Bradley Byrne]], [[Mike D. Rogers]], [[Robert Aderholt]], [[Morris J. Brooks]], [[Martha Roby]], and [[Gary Palmer (politician)|Gary Palmer]]) and one Democrat: [[Terri Sewell]] who represents the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] as well as most of the predominantly black portions of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] and [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Alabama}}

===Primary and secondary education===
[[File:Vestavia Hills High School.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vestavia Hills High School]] in the suburbs of Birmingham]]

Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the [[Alabama State Board of Education]] as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alsde.edu/sec/comm/Pages/quickfacts-item.aspx?FilterField1=ID&amp;FilterValue1=7 |title= Alabama Education Quick Facts 2012–13 |accessdate =April 29, 2014 |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, more than 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National [[No Child Left Behind]] law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.

While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data (2000), Alabama's high school graduation rate (75%) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf |title=Educational Attainment : 2000 : Census 2000 Brief |website=Census.gov |accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html Education Statistics]. CensusScope.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally prohibited in the [[Western world|West]] at large, [[school corporal punishment]] is not unusual in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students [[paddle (spanking)|paddled]] at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year.&lt;ref&gt;This figure refers to only the number of students paddled, and does not refer to the number of instances of corporal punishment, which would be higher.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot; /&gt; The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed only by Mississippi and Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corpun.com/counuss.htm |title= Corporal punishment in US schools |publisher=[[World Corporal Punishment Research]] |last = Farrell |first = Colin | date=February 2016 |accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are four medical schools (as of fall 2015) ([[University of Alabama School of Medicine]], [[University of South Alabama]] and [[Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine]] and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine—Auburn Campus), two veterinary colleges ([[Auburn University]] and [[Tuskegee University]]), a dental school ([[University of Alabama School of Dentistry]]), an optometry college ([[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]), two pharmacy schools ([[Auburn University]] and [[Samford University]]), and five law schools ([[University of Alabama School of Law]], [[Birmingham School of Law]], [[Cumberland School of Law]], [[Miles Law School]], and the [[Thomas Goode Jones School of Law]]). Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the [[Alabama Commission on Higher Education]] and the [[Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education]].

===Aviation===
{{Main|Aviation in Alabama}}

Major airports with sustained operations in Alabama include [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM), [[Huntsville International Airport]] (HSV), [[Dothan Regional Airport]] (DHN), [[Mobile Regional Airport]] (MOB), [[Montgomery Regional Airport]] (MGM), [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]]&lt;!--no longer Muscle Shoals Aux--&gt; (MSL) and [[Northeast Alabama Regional Airport]] (GAD).

===Rail===
For rail transport, [[Amtrak]] schedules the ''[[Crescent (train)|Crescent]]'', a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with station stops at [[Anniston station|Anniston]], [[Birmingham station (Alabama)|Birmingham]], and [[Tuscaloosa station|Tuscaloosa]].

===Roads===
Alabama has six major interstate routes: [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate 65]] (I-65) travels north–south roughly through the middle of the state; [[Interstate 20 in Alabama|I-20]]/[[Interstate 59 in Alabama|I-59]] travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham, where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and I-20 continues east towards [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]; [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|I-85]] originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] traverses the southernmost portion of the state, traveling from west to east through Mobile. [[Interstate 22 in Alabama|I-22]] enters the state from [[Mississippi]] and connects Birmingham with [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: [[Interstate 165 (Alabama)|I-165]] in Mobile, [[Interstate 359|I-359]] in Tuscaloosa, [[Interstate 459|I-459]] around Birmingham, [[Interstate 565|I-565]] in Decatur and Huntsville, and [[Interstate 759|I-759]] in Gadsden. A sixth route, [[Interstate 685|I-685]], will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as [[Interstate 422|I-422]]. Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible, [[Interstate 222|I-222]] has been proposed, as well.

Several U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as [[U.S. Route 11 in Alabama|U.S. Route 11]] (US-11), [[U.S. Route 29 in Alabama|US-29]], [[U.S. Route 31 in Alabama|US-31]], [[U.S. Route 43 in Alabama|US-43]], [[U.S. Route 45 in Alabama|US-45]], [[U.S. Route 72 in Alabama|US-72]], [[U.S. Route 78 in Alabama|US-78]], [[U.S. Route 80 in Alabama|US-80]], [[U.S. Route 82 in Alabama|US-82]], [[U.S. Route 84 in Alabama|US-84]], [[U.S. Route 90 in Alabama|US-90]], [[U.S. Route 98 in Alabama|US-98]], [[U.S. Route 231 in Alabama|US-231]], [[U.S. Route 278 in Alabama|US-278]], [[U.S. Route 280 in Alabama|US-280]], [[U.S. Route 331 in Alabama|US-331]], [[U.S. Route 411 in Alabama|US-411]], and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|US-431]].

There are four toll roads in the state: Montgomery Expressway in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]; Northport/Tuscaloosa Western Bypass in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] and [[Northport, Alabama|Northport]]; Emerald Mountain Expressway in [[Wetumpka, Alabama|Wetumpka]]; and Beach Express in [[Orange Beach, Alabama|Orange Beach]].

===Ports===
The [[Port of Mobile]], Alabama's only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] by way of the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]]. The Port of Mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the United States during 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonstraffic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Table 1086.
